"Petition to rename ""ROS"" threads","Considering we started ""Rest of Season"" threads for each player after every single week, we should just call them ""Rest of Week"" (ROW).

I still think there is a place for ROS threads, for instance after a big trade or injury... but if we're just going to repose the question because the player had a good or bad game, they just just be called ROW.

Tyler Boyd Breakdown (With and Without AJ Green '18-'19),"**Tyler Boyd Breakdown (With and Without AJ Green '18-'19)**

I've been reading a lot of comments saying things like ""Boyd will be better when AJ returns"" or ""Boyd won't be as good when AJ returns"". So I wanted to put some stats together from last year and this year for some more information. Interested to see how people will interpret these stats in the comments. Scoring is .5 PPR. 

**TL;DR/Analysis**

||Games|Tgt|Rec|Yds|Y/R|TD|Ctch%|Y/Tgt|Snp Pct|Fantasy|STDEV|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|With AJ|8|8.25|**6.13**|**77.50**|12.39|**0.63**|**73%**|**9.32**|86%|**14.56**|8.46|
|Without AJ|11|**8.55**|5.82|74.00|**13.54**|0.27|68%|9.08|**88%**|11.95|**5.52**|

* Boyd's targets get a slight bump when AJ is out
* Boyd's Y/R does go up when AJ is out. 
* Fantasy points per game increases when AJ plays, but he is less consistent. 
* TD rate significantly drops without AJ.
* Receptions and yards per game are pretty close to the same.
* Catch rate is lower this year, due to Andy Dalton being worse and a new offense (imo)

Personally, I think that Boyd will continue to be pretty close to the same player when AJ comes back, fantasy-wise. I believe the only thing holding him back right now is TDs. Whether those will come or not, I'm not sure. 

**Game by game stats below with averages...**

Here we have Weeks 10-15. AJ came back to play in Week 13 but left shortly after the game started, only playing 25% of snaps and receiving 1 target. For that reason, I've included Week 13 in this set of games. Also of note - Boyd left Week 15 early due to injury and only played 49% of snaps.

DVOA from https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2019


DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average) calculates a team's success based on the down-and-distance of each play during the season, then calculates how much more or less successful each team is compared to the league average.


DVOA Pass/Run Defense Rank: Team’s NFL rank in DVOA pass or run defense so far this season. #1 means best DEF against the pass/run, #32 means worst DEF against the pass/run.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Week 6 slate provides a grudge match between two NFC South contenders, with the loser facing an uphill battle to win the division. **Cam Newton**  may have lost Carolina’s Week 2 TNF matchup against the Bucs with his inaccurate arm, but they still had a chance to win the game with CMC’s legs in the closing seconds, until he was stuffed at the goal line. **Kyle Allen (upgrade)**  has been used primarily as a game manager and taken a backseat to the CMC show, but with TB having the No. 1 run defense so far, they may be pushed to get the ball in the air this week to win. He can be considered a back-end QB1. **Curtis Samuel (upgrade)**  and **D.J. Moore (upgrade)**  were both victims of Newton’s struggles in the first meeting of the year, but Tampa’s secondary was ripe for exploitation - Newton just couldn’t get the ball to his speedy receivers, missing Samuel on several deep throws or getting the ball to him late, causing him to be tackled well short of where the play could have gone. TB is giving up the most FPPG to opposing wideouts and Carolina will begin to hit on the deep ball at some point, this week could very well be it. Consider both upside WR3’s. **Greg Olsen**  also draws an extremely favorable matchup, TB is giving up the second most FPPG to tight ends (12.5) and Olsen should be considered a top-6 tight end this week.      


**RB Breakdown** 


**Christian McCaffery**  continues to eat and is still in the mix for the overall RB1, even going against the best run defense in the league so far. His involvement in all facets of the game keep his floor high. He’s questionable but expected to play, owners should grab **Reggie Bonnafun**  in case CMC’s health goes sideways before kickoff.

**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Chris Godwin (26%) Mike Evans (23%) Dare Ogunbowale (10%) Breshad Perriman (9%) O.J. Howard (8%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:**  Ronald Jones (34%, 11, 3) Peyton Barber (34%, 9, 1) Dare Ogunbowale (32%, 3, 3)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The roller coaster ride of having **Jameis Winston** on your fantasy squad continues to provide it’s peaks and valleys. There have been more peaks this season than years past and Winston is the #10 QB through 5 weeks. Even in a down week loss to the Saints last week, Winston put up a respectable 17.5 fantasy points and didn’t turn the ball over once. It’s possible he’s turned a corner, but it’s also just as likely that the next bust week is right around the corner… The emergence of **Chris Godwin** has certainly helped the oft-scrutinized quarterback, and Godwin has become a true WR1 in fantasy - he’s sitting pretty as the overall WR1 through 5 weeks. Godwin’s ascent has brought fellow wideout **Mike Evans** back to earth, as he only saw 3 targets last week in his duel with Saints stud CB Marcus Lattimore. Next on deck is a matchup with another elite CB in James Bradberry, a player that has thwarted Evans multiple times in his career, including their last matchup in Week 2. Consider Evans a feast-or-famine WR2 this week in the bad matchup. With field stretcher **Breshad Perriman** not traveling to London, tight end **O.J Howard**  is in a position to gain a larger target share. It may not matter however, as the Panthers have the leagues fifth-best defense against tight ends, only giving up a stingy 4 FPPG to the position. Howard is impossible to trust at this point and should be considered a TE2. 


**RB Breakdown** 


**Peyton Barber**  and **Ronald Jones** continue to kill each others value and neither should be treated as more than RB3’s. Going up against one of the league's worst run defenses is a prime position to get a boom week out of one of these players, but it’s impossible to know who will get the volume to produce. **Dare Ogunbowale** isn’t seeing the field enough to be a fantasy asset, leave him on the wire.

**Injuries to Watch DEF (BAL):**  CB Jimmy Smith (out)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (CIN):**  OT Cordy Glenn (DNP, likely out), WR Alex Erickson, AJ Green (out), John Ross (out)


**Key WR/CB matchups:**  Tyler Boyd vs. Marlon Humphrey (Rotoworld)


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):**  Tyler Boyd (26%) John Ross (19%) Auden Tate (16%) Tyler Eifer (10%) Joe Mixon (8%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:**  Joe Mixon (63%, 20, 1) Bernard (39%, 5, 3)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Bengals couldn’t snag their first win in the participation trophy bowl last week, but it’s ok because Zac Taylor believes his team is all “going in the same direction”. Um, ok i guess. **Andy Dalton** did show signs of life in the 4th quarter, finishing with 262 yards and 2 TDs, but continues to be inconsistent and makes numerous mistakes every week. The Ravens have not been good on defense this year, and will be without CB Jimmy Smith again this week, but Dalton is no more than a bye week QB2 filler, albeit one in a projected shootout. **Tyler Boyd** gets a tough matchup against Humphrey, but his volume keeps him in the WR2 mix, especially in PPR leagues. **Auden Tate (upgrade)** should be the beneficiary with easier matchups, and he makes for a solid low end WR3 based on his usage the past few weeks. **Tyler Eifert (drop)** couldn’t get it going even against Arizona last week, so if you haven’t yet done him the courtesy of putting him back on the wire, do so now for his dignity as much as yours.


**RB Breakdown** 


In their first drive last week the Bengals ran almost every play, and their continuous chunk plays should have led to a TD. But after that drive, they struggled to generate any running lanes, and steadily gave up on the run game as the Cardinals jumped out to a lead. **Joe Mixon (downgrade PPR)** hit a season-high in rushing with 93 yards, but 60 of those were on the opening drive. He also turned his one target into a 16 yard catch. Mixon’s lack of involvement in the passing game is a big problem, as the Bengals will likely be in negative game flow for a majority of their remaining games. With the Bengals below-average offense not reaching the red zone very often, Mixon’s chances for rushing TD’s have decreased as well. If the Ravens get off to a good start, it’s easy to imagine Mixon finishing with around 75 rushing yards, no TD, and one catch for 10 yards again this week. That 8-10 point line is decent for an RB2, but makes for a risky start in PPR leagues, and isn’t the type of production owners that drafted Mixon early are counting on him for. Consider him a back end RB2 that needs to either get into the end zone or bust a big play in the passing game to have any chance at a ceiling game. **Gio Bernard (stash)** continues to out target Mixon, and has run more routes overall this season as well. He has no standalone value, but in the event of a Mixon injury, would potentially be a more valuable play than Mixon has been so far because of his likely 3 down role. He’s a valuable handcuff to roster at this point.


#**Ravens** 


**Opp (CIN) Pass DVOA:**  #31


**Opp (CIN) Run DVOA:**  #26


**Injuries to Watch DEF (CIN):**  LB Nick Vigil (limited)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (BAL):**  WR Marquise Brown (DNP, Q), Mark Andrews (full practice, Q)


**Key WR/CB matchups:**  None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):**  Mark Andrews (23%) Marquise Brown (23%) Willie Snead (10%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:**  Mark Ingram (65%, 21, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Ravens offense has cooled a bit in recent weeks, but they have still put up 23+ points in every game. **Lamar Jackson (upgrade)** has been a top-5 QB based mostly on his rushing ability, and he’s put in enough in the passing game to make him an every week set and forget. He’s no Pat Mahomes, but he’s also no Tim Tebow either. **Mark Andrews (upgrade)**  is tied for the highest target share on the team, and is an easy top-6 TE at an extremely thin position. The Cincy defense is 7th stingiest against TE’s (NFL.com) but Andrews will be a target hog this week, especially if the Ravens are missing their top WR. **Marquise Brown (downgrade PPR)**  is questionable to play after missing practice Wednesday and Thursday, so his status is worth monitoring closely heading into the weekend. If he does play, he makes for a solid WR3 because of his high target volume and big play ability, but may not be needed much if the Ravens pound the run at home. If he is forced to miss the game, **Willie Snead**  would enter the streaming radar as he has shown a solid connection with Jackson so far. Even as the top WR, however, he’d be no more than a WR4 with some decent PPR upside.


**RB Breakdown** 


The Ravens haven’t been quite as run heavy as some predicted, but **Mark Ingram (upgrade)**  has gotten just enough volume to be a top-10 RB so far this season. Going up against a defense that has given up the second most FPPG to opposing RB’s, and as a huge home favorite, Ingram makes for a top 5 RB play in Week 6. He’s a chalk play in DFS, and might be in a week-winning position on Sunday. ** Gus Edwards** and ** Justice Hill**  are no more than handcuffs for worried Ingram owners at this point.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:**  Chris Carson (84%, 28, 2)  Rashaad Penny (16%, 8, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Seahawks have managed to grind out a number of wins this year, and last week’s TNF matchup against the Rams was no exception. **Russell Wilson**  basically willed Seattle to victory, and he put on a clinic of efficient passing. He has yet to throw an INT this year, and is making an underwhelming cast of weapons look like a top-10 offense. Even against a solid pass defense that may get their starting CBs back this week, Wilson has been too good this year to consider benching. This does profile as one of the tougher matchups he’s faced this year, so expectations should be tempered slightly. **Tyler Lockett (downgrade)** is unlikely to face consistent coverage from either of the Browns young stud CBs (assuming they play) but his lack of volume of late (4 targets each of the last two weeks) make it harder to project a big week for him. The Browns have been much more vulnerable on the ground than through the air, so expect the overall passing volume to be lowered slightly. Lockett has really only had one big game all year, and it was against NO when the Seahawks were down big early. Assuming the Browns struggle again to put up points offensively, this doesn’t initially project as a game that should feature negative game script. **DK Metcalf (downgrade)** is the more likely WR to face some kind of shadow coverage on the outside, and combining that with his smaller target share, he’s more of a WR4 that you can only start in hopes of one long TD play. **Will Dissly (upgrade)** has been one of the surprises of the season with his strong play, and with the Browns giving up the 8th most FPPG to opposing TEs, he remains firmly planted in the top 8 of the position this week.


**RB Breakdown**


Despite some early fumbling issues, **Chris Carson (upgrade)** has been given a big workload in all but one game this year, and that was in a matchup that featured negative game flow right from the start (Week 3 vs. NO). Carson got 28 touches last week, and caught his only target for the go-ahead TD late in the game. The Browns are fresh off getting absolutely obliterated in the run game by the Niners and now go up against a Seattle team that runs the ball almost as much. Carson is a lock for 20+ touches, and has a great shot at a TD. He’s on the RB1/2 borderline, and just needs a slight uptick in targets to break into the top-12 ROS. **Rashaad Penny (stash)** isn’t garnering enough touches for standalone value, but remains an extremely valuable handcuff.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


There’s no sugarcoating just how bad **Baker Mayfield (upgrade)** has been as a fantasy QB so far this year. He’s barely in the top-30 at the position through 5 weeks, and there’s just something wrong with this offense. This feels like a good game for Mayfield to put up a better line, and he may actually be available on the waiver wire this week. He’s nowhere near back to QB1 status, but going up against a burnable Seahawks secondary in a game the Browns could face some negative game script, Mayfield may surprise this week. We project him as a high end QB2, worth starting for owners in a bye week pinch. The biggest factor for Mayfield’s value is tied to getting **Odell Beckham Jr. (upgrade)** going for more than 2 catches. There are major concerns about OBJ’s fit in this offense with the lack of an offensive line meaning fewer downfield shots, but I think he gets going this week against Seattle. **Jarvis Landry** has only had one big week all year, but his floor in PPR remains usable because of his solid target share and low aDOT leading to high percentage looks. He’s a low upside WR3, and deserves to be bumped to WR4 range in standard leagues. His weekly 5-50 projection is usable, but not extremely exciting. **Antonio Callaway (downgrade)** didn’t move the needle much in his return, and isn’t a must own at this point because of the lack of downfield throwing in this offense.


**RB Breakdown**


One week after steamrolling the Ravens defense on the ground, **Nick Chubb** wasn’t able to get going in a blowout loss to the Niners last week. The volume is still there, and he’s a threat to take it to the house on any given play, so he needs to be in all lineups this week. A bigger role in the passing game would be a boon to his value, so hopefully Freddie Kitchens can find creative ways to get perhaps his most talented player the ball on Sunday.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Carlos Hyde (64%, 21, 1) Duke Johnson (40%, 10, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Last week’s fantasy bonanza against the Falcons featured a massive game from **Deshaun Watson (upgrade)**. KC has actually been stingy against QBs at home this year, but there’s no reason to view Watson as anything other than a top-3 QB play in the week’s highest projected scoring game. **DeAndre Hopkins** was unable to get in on the TD fun last week, but still finished with a respectable 88 yards on seven catches. He’s simply too talented to be held down for long, and has dusted more talented CBs than Breeland with ease over the years. He remains a top 10 WR play, and this is an ideal week for him to bust back onto the scene. **Will Fuller (upgrade)** went absolutely nuclear last week, and probably sent owners who benched him into therapy. There is no sure thing with a boom or bust player like Fuller, but in a shootout with Hopkins drawing likely shadow coverage, Fuller is set up beautifully to back up last week’s performance. He has to be in all lineups. **Keke Coutee** showed a little more last week, but is still only a stash at this point in case of injury to Hopkins or Fuller, not someone you can plug into your lineup.


**RB Breakdown**


This is one of the more frustrating backfields from a fantasy perspective, as either **Carlos Hyde (upgrade standard)** or **Duke Johnson** would be borderline RB1s if given a full workload, but neither is getting the volume necessary for big lines. Hyde is the better bet for a rushing TD, and is likely to get a solid volume of carries in the first half while the Texans try to keep Mahomes and company off the field. That plan could fall apart quickly, but Hyde’s floor is decent in standard leagues. DJ has drawn only 7 targets total over the past 3 weeks, and just isn’t getting the volume to be a worthwhile play. There is hope he’ll be used more in negative game script in a high scoring game, but it would take a major leap of faith to start him. Consider Hyde an RB2/3, with a bump in standard leagues, and Duke an RB4 with upside for a big play or two.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Damien Williams (56%, 12, 4) Lesean McCoy (22%, 2, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


There was some concern that **Patrick Mahomes** would be limited this week after injuring his ankle last week, but he has been clear that the issue won’t stop him from being at his best on Sunday. He’s an easy top-3 QB. **Tyreek Hill** may have an opportunity to return this week after logging two limited practices, so keep a close eye on his status heading into the weekend. Houston held up better than the stats showed against Matt Ryan last week, but would be absolutely no match for one of the better QB-WR duos in the league, assuming health. **Sammy Watkins** was a DNP on Thursday with a hammy issue, and his status looks to be a legitimate concern. If Hill is unable to return and Watkins can’t play, **Byron Pringle** would get in the mix in 3 wide sets next to **Demarcus Robinson** and **Mecole Hardman**. All three would be in play as WR3’s in this matchup if Hill and Watkins are out, but Robinson is probably the best bet if Hill or Watkins do play, considering his target share. **Travis Kelce (upgrade)** will need to step up in Watkins can’t play, so look for him to again have a big role and put up top-3 TE numbers.


**RB Breakdown**


One of the messier backfields so far this year surprisingly got a lot more clear when **Damien Williams** returned to the lineup last week. He immediately returned to starter status, receiving 12 touches to **Lesean McCoy’s** 2 touches, and **Darrel Williams’** 0 touches. Because Damien is used so frequently in the passing game, his floor should be that of a decent RB2, especially in PPR leagues. His ceiling in a projected shootout like this is top-10, so he should be in all lineups barring a late injury setback. McCoy could get a few more touches this week, but likely needs to be benched, and Darrel Williams becomes just a handcuff for Damien owners. Damien may just be able to pay off for patient owners who were able to survive his early season injury.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


**Teddy ‘Checkdown’ Bridgewater** exploded last week against a poor Tampa secondary, throwing for 314 yards with 4 scores. Even with the breakout week, he’s no more than a 2QB league play or a one week streamer in good matchups. **Michael Thomas (upgrade)** has not slowed down in the absence of **Drew Brees** and it appears he’s a matchup proof WR1 moving forward, just keep in mind there may be some bumps along the way with Bridgewater at the controls. It appears that CB Jalen Ramsey is truly questionable to play (Jag’s owner Shahid Khan has said he’ll play, grain of salt), and his absence would be a huge upgrade to Thomas’ outlook. **Tre’Quan Smith (ankle)** was unable to return with an injury last week and **Ted Ginn** found his way into the endzone with a long score, but none of the peripheral pass catchers should be considered. **Jared Cook** finally showed up, posting 4-41-1 last week. He can be considered a low-end TE1 in a mediocre matchup, just remember his floor is scary low. 


**RB Breakdown**


**Alvin Kamara** has popped up on the injury report late in the week which is never a good sign. He’s fully expected to play, but owners should grab **Latavius Murray** as an insurance policy. The matchup for the Saints running game is as optimal as they come, Jacksonville ranks dead last in Run DVOA and is giving up 23.1 FPPG to running backs. Kamara is in the mix for the overall RB1 this week.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Leonard Fournette (93%, 27, 7) Ryquell Armstead (7%, 2, 1) 


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Rookie mistakes cost **Gardner Minshew (upgrade)** last week as he lost 3 fumbles, but he still gave his team a chance to win in a back and forth battle with the Panthers. Minshew has been as consistent as they come at the QB position, he has averaged 17.8 FPPG and has yet to score less than 16 fantasy points since taking over as the starter. If Minshew puts up a big week against a solid NO defense, he will likely be impossible to keep out of lineups. Consider him a back-end QB1 against the Saints middle of the road defense - they are giving up 23.7 FPPG to quarterbacks, third worst. **D.J. Chark** continued his impressive breakout, showing out with 8-164-2 last week. He can’t be denied a spot in your lineup due to upside, even with a date against Marshon Lattimore who just held Mike Evans to a goose egg, consider him a WR2 this week. Another good week and he may be pushing into the WR1 ranks. If Lattimore does indeed shadow Chark, then **Dede Westbrook** would draw the better matchup, going against SCB P.J. Williams. Consider him an upside WR3. **Chris Conley** isn’t seeing enough volume to be a consistent option in fantasy and is best left on the wire. The Saints secondary has been exploitable this season, giving up 28.6 FPPG to wideouts. Continue to fade Jacksonville’s tight ends.  


**RB Breakdown**


**Leonard Fournette** has received the second most touches (115) so far this season, only behind superhuman Christian McCaffery (136). The matchup on paper isn’t ideal, NO is only giving up 14 FPPG to running backs. However, Fournette’s volume provides him a safe floor and he should be in all lineups.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Jordan Howard (43%, 13, 4) Miles Sanders (43%, 13, 5)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The most valuable player to the Eagles last week was wearing a Jets jersey, and his name is Luke Falk. He allowed the Eagles D to turn two mistakes into TDs, and was unable to put anything together on offense. This meant that none of the Philly weapons on offense needed to do much to win, so **Carson Wentz** ended with a slightly disappointing day. His matchup this week is significantly tougher against a defense that has given up the 8th fewest FPPG to opposing QBs and ranks as a top 10 defense in both pass and run DVOA. He is still a solid QB1 option. **Alshon Jeffery (upgrade standard)** is back to full health and this week goes up against Xavier Rhodes, who has been burned by Jeffery in past matchups (Rotoworld). This isn’t a shy away matchup for either Wentz or Jeffery, and because the Eagles have a strong run defense, the Vikings strategy to control the game on the ground may not be as successful. This feels like a game where Jeffery hits the end zone. **Zach Ertz** remains a reliable weekly top-3 TE due to target share and his connection with Wentz is in fine form. **Nelson Agholor (drop)** likely only has one week left of receiving a decent target share with DJax possibly returning next week, so he can be dropped for someone with better ROS outlook. He has the potential to sneak into the endzone this week, but his floor is that of a 0 catch 0 yard performance. Wentz is a back end QB1 this week, and Jeffery is right on the edge of a top-20 ranking at WR.


**RB Breakdown**


The Eagles have employed an RBBC so far this year, and in Week 5 found the split between **Jordan Howard (downgrade PPR)** and **Miles Sanders** to be almost exactly equal. Howard is getting the more valuable redzone carries, so his TD upside put his at the back end of the RB2 rankings. Sanders hasn’t been extremely efficient with his carries, and isn’t being used in the passing game as much as some had projected, but his four catches in Week 5 were encouraging. Coach Doug Pederson has said the Eagles will continue to ride the hot hand, and that appears to be Howard at the moment. Both can be used in the flex spot, but Howard is a safer option because of his tendency to end up in the end zone the past weeks (5 in last 3 games).

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Dalvin Cook (66%, 27, 6) Alexander Mattison (23%, 7, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Vikings passing game finally got up and running a bit last week, and **Kirk Cousins (upgrade)** finished with his best game of the season. On paper, this looks like a matchup to exploit through the air, as the Eagles are much more vulnerable there than on the ground, but it remains to be seen if OC Kevin Stefanski will adjust his gameplan at all. Cousins can be looked at in 2QB leagues, but still isn’t sniffing QB1 status until we see a consistent uptick in passing volume. He makes for an intriguing streamer this week, however. **Adam Thielen** has been Cousins’ preferred target the past few weeks, and has gotten his target share up close to 25%. While he still isn’t producing like the WR1 he was drafted to be, this week again sets up well for him to put up solid numbers. He should be in all lineups and can be counted on for WR2 numbers. **Stefon Diggs (upgrade)** is a slightly more risky proposition. He currently has a smaller target share than his starting RB, and has only one game over 50 yards receiving. While it’s tough to bench a player of Diggs’ talent, owners are likely extremely frustrated with his production so far. This feels like a get right matchup against the Eagles burnable secondary so we recommend you start him universally. Keep the faith for this week. **Kyle Rudolph (drop)** currently has a lower target share than his backup **Irv Smith** which tells the story of his fantasy irrelevance. If you’ve been holding this long, it’s time to let go.


**RB Breakdown**


Even in an extremely tough matchup this week, **Dalvin Cook** remains a top-3 RB play in all formats. He has shown his floor even in a game the Vikings are losing (Week 4 vs. CHI) to be 15+ points, so he is a clear auto-start. There may be some efficiency struggles on the ground due to Philly’s stout front seven, but he will bust at least one big play, and his involvement in the passing game keeps him elite even in the event the Eagles get out to a big lead. **Alexander Mattison (stash)** remains one of the league’s best handcuffs, so he should be universally owned. If you own Mattison but not Cook, consider seeing what you can pry from the Cook owner over the next few weeks.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Interim coach Bill Callahan has yet to name a starter at quarterback, but all indications point to **Case Keenum** being under center this week. He’s not an option in fantasy, but his return is great news for **Terry McLaurin** who seems to be recovered from a hamstring injury. The bad news is that ‘F1’ McLaurin will be facing off against the Dolphins best player, CB Xavien Howard. Nevertheless, McLaurin has earned must start status as a WR2 and he’ll be facing the worst defense in the NFL. Fire him up. **Paul Richardson** with a healthy McLaurin is too much of a question mark to see lineups even in the dream matchup. **Vernon Davis** is still making his way back from a concussion and it’s unclear if he will play. **Jeremy Sprinkle** and **Jerome Cunningham** will take over again if he is absent, but neither are recommended plays. 
 

**RB Breakdown**


Owners probably scooped up **Adrian Peterson (upgrade)** after the news broke that interim coach Callahan thinks that not running the ball enough is Washington's main issue (it’s not). He’s got a dream matchup on deck and should be considered a RB2/3, his floor remains scary low but it seems more likely than not that he finds pay dirt in Week 6’s poop fest. **Chris Thompson (upgrade PPR)** continues to produce in PPR, putting up a consistent 11.7 FPPG. Thompson can be considered a back-end RB2 with an upgrade in PPR formats. This game seems like it could go either way in terms of being high scoring or low scoring, so all options are a bit risky.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Miami from an offense standpoint, and just an overall football standpoint, have been awful. Remember that when Vegas favors a home team by 3 points, that’s essentially saying that both teams are completely even. **Josh Rosen** isn’t a fantasy option. **Preston Williams** and **Devante Parker** can be considered this week going against Washington's dreadful secondary, but really you probably have a better option at receiver. Even in the best matchup of the year, all Miami players are an extreme risk. Put your money on teams that you know can move the ball. **Albert Wilson** is an intriguing DFS play against a defense that has allowed the fourth-most PPR per game to slow WRs this season (per Sports Info Solutions and Rotoworld). Don’t play a Miami tight end, you know better. 


**RB Breakdown**


The running back rotation for Miami is an absolute mess and no running back has produced enough to see fantasy lineups. After a mistake filled start to the season, it appears that **Kalen Ballage** has fallen out of favor for rookie **Mark Walton**. If there were a surefire week to start **Kenyan Drake**, it seems like it would be this week. However, the Dolphins have been so putrid it seems like more risk than it’s worth. Fade the Dolphins backfield where possible.

Buy low with Air Yards: Week 5,"Hey all! I'm back to share Air Yards and Air Yards Opportunity Delta leaders for week 5!

**What are Air Yards?**

Air yards measures the sum of the depths of all of a receiver's targets.

**What is Air Yards Opportunity Delta?**

Opportunity Delta is the difference between a receiver's **air yards** and their **actual yardage.** In Josh Hermsmeyer's words, ""We can use air yards to help us unearth which receivers the quarterback and coaches would like to see get the ball—knowing that has predictive value.""

**Why should I care?**

This metric shows which receivers could stand the most to improve given their current opportunity. Perhaps their QB can't get on the same page as them. Maybe they just had a bad matchup or bad luck. But receivers on this list are getting lots of targets and opportunities, which generally correlates well with performance.

This data is available freely at Josh's website [airyards.com](https://airyards.com/). I've decided to compile a top-15 list of receivers by both Opportunity Delta as well as air yards. Enjoy!

"With a bunch of players in concussion protocol recently (Shep, Mason, Hock, etc) I felt this article is good for people to understand how it works and how to estimate your players coming back into a game","https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/9/18/12940926/nfl-concussion-protocol-explained

>**Return to play process**

>In addition to the in-game protocol, there is also a ""Return-to-Participation Protocol"" that can keep players out of action for more practices or games until they pass through and are cleared to return.

>It is a five-step process without any set timeline for a full return from a concussion:

>1) Rest and recovery: Until a player returns to the ""baseline level of signs and symptoms and neurological examination,"" only limited stretching and balance activities are recommended. Electronics, social media and team meetings are all to be avoided.

>2) Light aerobic exercise: The NFL recommends 10-20 minutes on a stationary bike or treadmill without resistance training or weight training. The cardiovascular activity is monitored by an athletic trainer to ""determine if there are any recurrent concussion signs or symptoms.""

>3) Continued aerobic exercise and introduction of strength training: Increased duration and intensity of aerobic exercise with strength training added. An athletic trainer will supervise to watch for recurrent concussions signs or symptoms.

>4) Football specific activities: The cognitive load of playing football will be added and players will participate in non-contact activities for the typical duration of a full practice.

>5) Full football activity/clearance: A player returns to full participation in practice, including contact without restriction.

Using a current example of Hock with the latest tweet coming from this excerpt: [A little T.J. Hockenson update from Matt Patricia: Hockenson is doing everything in practice. Still has one more day of doing that, then being re-checked by doctors before he's out of concussion protocol. Brain injuries are unpredictable, but Hockenson trending towards playing](https://twitter.com/davebirkett/status/1182679061799276545?s=21), there's a good chance from this tweet that Hock is currently in step 4 of the process and now needs to pass one last exam.  Hock owners should feel pretty good about this since with a Monday game, it gives Hock an extra day of rest and hopefully will allow him to exit protocol to be ready for the game.

Michel owners: My take as a lifelong Pats fan on why you should be encouraged by Michel going forward.,"TLDR: It's not all on Sony, we can't run him outside because we lost our ability to seal the edge and considering our troubles at WR, teams just pack the box against Sony. With the right pieces in place he will get better. He's a mid/low RB2 now with the potential to be low RB1, but hes not the RB4 and bench rider everyone is making him out to be.

I'm not an expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt and feel free to correct me or add where needed but this is just my opinion on watching close to every Pats game over the past 20 years.

I can't say it's really his fault. Losing Gronk was a much bigger deal than just his catch and target contribution. Gronk was an excellent blocker and was able to seal the edge which allowed our RBs to get to the outside. Frankly put, Izzo and Lacoste are just not good blockers. Now, Michel has always kind of been a North/South runner, but now we can't even fool the other team into thinking we can run outside. Most of our outside runs with Michel are just screen passes (since we can't seal the edge) where the WRs just jam the line but that is also painfully obvious to other teams once he is in motion or split out. Our desperation at our inability to be able to get outside is shown on the quick passes to Sony (who isn't really regarded as a good pass catcher but we have no choice to try to get him outside somehow).

I anticipate Bill will make some sort of acquisition to make this happen or retrain another position to be able to get there to seal the edge. We already have a compromised WR squad, leaving ourselves with up the gut runs as our only option is a huge vulnerability that I can't see Bill leaving open. I think if you had to chose one or the other, it's easier to retrain a player to seal it (or cheaper to acquire a TE who can) than it is to find a competent WR who can learn our playbook and system mid-season.

Oh, also, Develin (our awesome FB!) is out, so even his up the guts will struggle. Sony has his faults, mainly an inability to break tackles and reliance on the North South runs, but I would be encouraged by a 113yard stat line given the things that are holding him back currently",126,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dggpqc/michel_owners_my_take_as_a_lifelong_pats_fan_on/,205.07531221707663,r/fantasyfootball

Who are some good WR's with potential to target for trades before the deadline?,"Who are some people that aren't 100% owned, that you think have potential in the second half of the fantasy season, to become contributors/starters, on a WR weak team?

I for instance have been targeting Gallup... unfortunately he has an amazing week last week, so he's over 90% owned now.  Desean jackson is also another name that comes to mind, but I personally(as an eagles fan) am fearing that he might not even come back during this fantasy season.

Is Dontrell Hilliard the real Handcuff for Chubb?,"I know that everyone is sick of the Kareem Hunt posts, trust me I am too.

I've been wondering though, does anyone get the sense that Hilliard is going to be the true handcuff for Chubb and be the main beneficiary if something happened to Chubb even after week 9? I did a little digging and did see a research paper indicating that sports hernias do have a very good return to sport % with minimal to no reduction in performance, however it did indicate that its likely for the player sustaining on to have a shorter athletic career.

Hilliard also has been pretty solid when hes been given the ball this season and had solid stats in preseason. Hunt didn't exactly look as good in preseason. (editted this, where I was looking to find Hilliards stats for whatever reason didn't show for preseason rushing but going to the nfl page I saw his numbers looked decent).

I realize its a bit of speculation, I'm just curious if anyone has a conviction one way or the other on this. Hunt receives all the attention but is it reasonable to think given the time off the field, the injury, and the performance of Hilliard that Hunt's value is even less than it already is?",16,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgg920/is_dontrell_hilliard_the_real_handcuff_for_chubb/,238.84197913010914,r/fantasyfootball

ESPN Fantasy League Waiver Process Issue,"I'm having an issue in a league I help manage and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar.

Disrespect to GT3? ROS?,"https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player-news/9285001

Essentially the Giants' only weapon, Tate typically found himself glued to a Patriots defender, but he managed a number of tough catches versus tight coverage. That was the case against Jonathan Jones on Tate's 64-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Although he's still feisty, Tate is not the playmaker he once was. He figures to settle in as a low-end WR4 once Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard and Evan Engram can get back on the field.


This man went 6/102/1. Against the pats. Most of the time in double coverage. I understand he was essentially the only weapon last night but his blurb seems pretty incorrect to me. He has lead in YAC for years in a row. He wasnt even utilized correctly last night with his YAC ability.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

How to handle your studs not practicing,"This is mostly for ""newer"" fantasy players, or those who haven't own guys like Julio in the past.

In most cases, when you see the ""Q"" next to a players name, don't scramble. Especially on Thursdays, veterans don't practice if they have some minor injury (contusion, pain). They take it easy, study up, and get ready for Sunday/Monday. Don't scramble to pickup a backup, don't drop a decent bench player because you are afraid your star won't play- the fact of the matter is ""Questionable"" is, about 80% of the time, just a way of saying that player is making sure they're close to 100% for their game.

Obviously this isn't always true, and if you're stud (thinking Tyreek here) is questionable coming out of an injury, sometimes teams play it safe, but for the most part, Q isn't as scary as it seems.",21,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg6sx8/how_to_handle_your_studs_not_practicing/,1130.8419805804888,r/fantasyfootball

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team’s matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you’re in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‘Em game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn’t give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

"Official: [Simple Questions and League Issues] - Thu Evening, 10/10/2019","**DO NOT post Who Do I Start, Add Drop, or Trade questions in this thread; find the appropriate thread within the [INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day).**

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

The Scary Terry,"Hey all Terry Mclauren owners, just had a few questions ab Terry’s production this week. 

Quick reminder : As the redskins are playing a terrible dolphins team, if you own terry you start him. If not, you do not deserve the man. 


Now onto the questions/Thoughts 

-Does not having Keemun affect terry’s targets/production? (I haven’t heard of reports of the QB situation) I know he has the connection with Haskins, but even then he wasn’t Haskins #1 target. 

-With the firing of Gruden, does this affect the production of terry whatsoever? Is the intern head coach run heavy? 

-Finally, so just came out and said it was the best practice they have had all season, showing hope for them to get on track, boosting Terry’s value?

Regardless of what happens, I will forever be staring the man of the year, Scary Terry.",35,0.51,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg62w9/the_scary_terry/,1187.9919809142748,r/fantasyfootball

Rookie Report: Week 6 Starts & Sits,"**Drinkfive Rookie Report: Week 6**

&nbsp;

Welcome back to the Rookie Report! We’re another week deeper into the season and finally starting to get into the bye weeks where things can get a little dicey for your squads if you don’t have great depth. I wouldn’t expect to find much running back help from the rookie crop this week with David Montgomery, Josh Jacobs and Devin Singletary all on byes. Jacobs did put on a show across the pond on Sunday though. Week 5 also saw Kyler Murray get his first win, saw DK Metcalf and Marquise Brown each get back in the end zone, and saw another outstanding performance from Gardner Minshew albeit in a loss. The rookie running backs might have a bleak outlook this week, but there are plenty of other rookies to talk about. Let’s talk about what we can look forward to in week 6 from the rookie crop…

&nbsp;

**Rookies to Start:** 

&nbsp;

**QB Kyler Murray, ARI (Wk. 6: vs. Atl.):** The Falcons’ defense has really struggled this year, especially since Keanu Neal went down late in the first half of their week 3 game. They rank 30th in Football Outsiders’ pass defense DVOA stat and in the last 3 weeks they’ve allowed 963 passing yards and a 10:0 TD to INT ratio. They also allowed Marcus Mariota and Deshaun Watson to combine for 69 rushing yards (nice) in the last 2 weeks. Murray has started to use his legs as an asset, racking up 189 yards and 2 scores on the ground in his last 3 games. He may also get Christian Kirk back this week. The TDs will eventually come for Kyler. The Cardinals are tied for 4th in the NFL with an average of 4 red zone trips per game. I expect Murray to be a top-8 QB this week.

&nbsp;

**WR Terry McLaurin, WAS (Wk. 6: @Mia.):** Don’t be concerned about the coaching change in Washington when it comes to McLaurin. Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan is the guy taking over, so things shouldn’t change much. Former head coach Jay Gruden had a lot of control over the offense previously, so I would expect Callahan to put his own wrinkles in (most notably he’s talked about wanting to run more), but it should remain largely the same offense. The better news for McLaurin this week is that he should get Case Keenum back at QB. Keenum is much more willing to throw downfield than Colt McCoy. McLaurin also goes from facing the best defense in the league to one of the worst. Miami has been shredded by opposing WR1s so far, so McLaurin should be a safe WR3 in your lineups this week. 

&nbsp;

**WR Marquise Brown, BAL (Wk. 6: vs. Cin.):** Keep an eye on the injury report this week. Head coach John Harbaugh said Brown’s injury is nothing serious, but he isn’t practicing yet as of Thursday. If he does play and it sounds like he’ll be close to 100%, get him in your lineup. The Bengals rank 31st in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 3rd-highest yards per attempt in the league to opposing passing attacks. Baltimore has an implied total of 29.5 points, so there should be plenty of offense for them in this one. Other deep threat receivers have fared well against Cincy. DK Metcalf posted 4-89, Marquise Goodwin went 3-77-1, and they also allowed long scores to Diontae Johnson and Tyler Lockett this year. Brown shouldn’t be on your bench unless the injury keeps him there.

&nbsp;

**Borderline Rookies:** 

&nbsp;

**QB Gardner Minshew, JAX (Wk. 6: vs. NO):** I keep telling you to sit Minshew each week, and he keeps responding by making me look foolish. He’s continued to turn what look like limited upside matchups into efficient and strong QB2 performances. This week he has a matchup that actually does have some upside for him. Naturally, he’s going to inevitably lay an egg in the week that he should blow up because fantasy football likes to laugh at us, but this looks like a spot where he is a reasonable bye week fill-in and a must-start in 2QB formats. The Saints rank 20th in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 5th-most points per game to opposing QBs on the year. 4 of the 5 QBs they’ve faced topped 20 fantasy points. Minshew is an interesting option in DFS cash games this week that could allow you to spend your money on the other positions. He’s the 25th-highest priced QB on DraftKings ($5,000) but has yet to finish worse than the QB16 in any week this year.

&nbsp;

**WR Mecole Hardman, KC (Wk. 6: vs. Hou.):** I’d lean toward starting Mecole this week if you’ve got him, especially if Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins both sit out. As of Wednesday, it sounds like Hill will be a game-time call, and Watkins is probably on the wrong side of questionable. Houston has allowed the 9th-most WR points per game on the year and the Chiefs have an implied total of 30 points. If Watkins and Hill both sit, 3-wide sets will consist of Hardman, Demarcus Robinson, and Byron Pringle. All 3 would have upside in this matchup, but I’d prefer Hardman over the other two. The return of Hill or Watkins would push him down to more of a WR4 this week.

&nbsp;

**WR Preston Williams, MIA (Wk. 6: vs. Was.):** It feels awkward calling any Dolphin even as much as a borderline fantasy play, but Preston fits the bill this week. Washington has allowed the 3rd-most WR points per game, and Williams has been the target on nearly a quarter of Josh Rosen’s pass attempts this season. Rosen being named the starter for the remainder of the year is unquestionably a positive thing for Williams’ fantasy outlook. Preston has topped 10 PPR points in 3 out his 4 games this year, and he did that against tougher opponents than Washington. Williams is a reasonable WR3/flex option if you’re dealing with injuries or byes at the position this week.

&nbsp;

**WR DK Metcalf, SEA (Wk. 6: @Cle.):** Metcalf’s deep ball upside keeps him in play as a WR3/flex option, but this might not be the best week for him. The Browns have had a conservative approach on the back end of the defense, taking away the deep ball and letting teams beat them underneath. They’ve allowed just 12 passes of 20+ yards though 5 games. It only takes one big play for Metcalf but be aware that he’s a volatile option.

&nbsp;

**Rookies to Sit:** 

&nbsp;

**QB Daniel Jones, NYG (Wk. 6: @NE):** Jones posted his worst start of the year in week 5, and things look unlikely to get much better this week. Saquon Barkley, Evan Engram, Sterling Shepard and Wayne Gallman have all been ruled out already for Thursday night’s game and the Giants have an implied total below 14 points. The Patriots rank 2nd in pass defense DVOA and haven’t allowed at TD pass all year. They also have 11 interceptions through 5 games. This is the worst possible spot to start Jones.

&nbsp;

**QB Devlin Hodges, PIT (Wk. 6: @LAC):** Hodges came into last Sunday’s game against the Ravens after an Earl Thomas hit knocked Mason Rudolph out cold, and he appears likely to get the starting nod this week. He didn’t look completely lost in his first NFL action, completing 7 of 9 passes for 68 yards and adding a 20-yard run, but there were some other incompletions (including an INT) that were negated by penalties. It would be a huge gamble to roll the dice on the undrafted rookie this week. The Chargers rank just 25th in pass defense DVOA, but only Deshaun Watson has reached 20 fantasy points against them. The Steelers are likely to go with as run-heavy a game plan as they can this week.

&nbsp;

**QB Dwayne Haskins, WAS (Wk. 6: @Mia.):** Bill Callahan made it clear after taking over as the new head coach that he shares Jay Gruden’s outlook for Haskins: they don’t want him starting right now. Callahan said Haskins may be inactive some weeks with Keenum and McCoy both healthy. There is no reason to hold onto Haskins in redraft leagues right now.

&nbsp;

**RB Miles Sanders, PHI (Wk. 6: @Min.):** Sanders is a really dicey flex option this week after comments from Doug Pederson that Jordan Howard will get more carries going forward. Howard has been a more decisive runner and has taken advantage of the Eagles’ mauling offensive line more effectively than Sanders has. The rookie may have a saving grace this week with Darren Sproles sidelined. It should be Sanders working as the primary receiving back this week (unless Corey Clement pops up). The problem is that Minnesota has allowed the 2nd-fewest RB receptions and receiving yards per game. I’d avoid playing Sanders this week unless you have to. Even if he still sees ok rushing volume, the Vikings rank 2nd in run defense DVOA.

&nbsp;

**RB Tony Pollard, DAL (Wk. 6: @NYJ):** There is a chance that Pollard actually has a nice week at the Meadowlands. Pollard averaged 11 touches per game in the Cowboys’ 3 easy wins to open the year, and then played just 7 combined offensive snaps in the two losses since. The Cowboys are a touchdown favorite on Sunday, so Pollard may get involved late. The reason I list him as a ‘rookie to sit’ is because the Jets do have a decent run defense (11th in run defense DVOA) and I really don’t know what kind of league I would be desperate enough to play him in. 

&nbsp;

**RB Alexander Mattison, MIN (Wk. 6: vs. Phi.):** Mattison continued his trend of flashing in games with positive game script in week 5. He’s averaged 53 scrimmage yards per game in the Vikings’ 3 wins and just 19 yards in their 2 losses. Minnesota is a 3-point favorite this week, but I wouldn’t be looking for another 50-yard day out of Mattison. The Eagles have wiped out opposing running games, allowing less than 50 rushing yards per game to opposing backfields. Dalvin Cook might struggle to get to 50 yards on the ground in this one. I don’t expect there to be much left over for the rookie.

&nbsp;

**RB Justice Hill, BAL (Wk. 6: vs. Cin.):** The matchup in week 6 is a juicy one for Baltimore’s backfield. The Bengals allow the 2nd-most RB points per game and rank 26th in run defense DVOA, but Hill has been an afterthought in this offense. He played the fewest snaps that he has all year in week 5. His DraftKings price tag is just $3,200, so you could roll the dice on him getting some extended run in a GPP tournament if you’re feeling feisty, but Gus Edwards is likely the biggest benefactor if the Ravens win in a rout.

&nbsp;

**RB Ryquell Armstead, JAX (Wk. 6: vs. NO):** Armstead followed up a strong performance in week 4 with a disappearing act in week 5. He’s got 12 touches on the year, and 9 of them were in that week 4 contest. He’s no more than a Leonard Fournette handcuff at this point with next to no standalone value.

&nbsp;

**RB Dexter Williams, GB (Wk. 6: vs. Det.):** Dexter seemed to have a prime opportunity to step up last weekend with Jamaal Williams sidelined. Instead the Packers activated Tra Carson from their practice squad and let him serve as the #2 back. Apparently, Dexter’s pass blocking isn’t where it needs to be for the Packers to trust him on the field. There isn’t any reason to have him rostered in redraft formats.

&nbsp;

**WR Diontae Johnson, PIT (Wk. 6: @LAC):** Johnson has had a healthy target share for the Steelers since Big Ben went down and the Chargers are in the middle of the pack when it comes to points allowed to WRs, but Devlin Hodges at QB means I’m not willing to trust Diontae in lineups this week, even with James Washington sidelined. Johnson also needs to fix his ball control issues going forward. He’s fumbled twice in as many weeks, and his playing time will start to go down if that continues.

&nbsp;

**WR Miles Boykin, BAL (Wk. 6: vs. Cin.):** Boykin gets a decent matchup against the Bengals this week. As I mentioned with Hollywood Brown earlier, they rank 31st in pass defense DVOA, and the Ravens have an implied team total of just under 30 points. Unfortunately for Boykin, he’s settled in as a guy playing right around 30% of the offensive snaps each week. That just isn’t enough playing time to trust him even in good matchups. This isn’t a bad week to hope he finds the end zone, but that’s really as much as you can hope for here unless Brown misses this game. If Brown is out, Boykin should get a little additional run but is still more of a dart throw than reliable option.

&nbsp;

**WR Andy Isabella, ARI (Wk. 6: vs. Atl.):** Kliff Kingsbury stayed mostly true to his word last weekend and didn’t move Andy Isabella into the slot to replace Christian Kirk. Instead he used a rotation of Pharoh Cooper and his 2 tight ends (Maxx Williams & Charles Clay). Isabella did see a season-high 10 snaps, but he wasn’t targeted at all. He did get 2 rushing attempts. It sounds like Kirk will return this week, but even if he doesn’t, Isabella isn’t a guy to consider.

&nbsp;

**TE Irv Smith, MIN (Wk. 6: vs. Phi.):** Smith played 51% of the Vikings’ offensive snaps last week…and wasn’t targeted even once. There will be weeks where the ball comes his way, but those weeks will be hard to predict in this low volume passing offense.

&nbsp;

**TE TJ Hockenson, DET (Wk. 6: @GB):** The fact that the Lions had to come out after Hockenson’s concussion and say that he won’t be put on IR doesn’t make it sound like he’ll be back right away. Stunningly he was back at practice Wednesday & Thursday, but he is still in the concussion protocol. It seems like he’s trending in the right direction, but he could end up a game-time decision and the Packers have allowed the 6th-fewest tight end points per game this year. Since Hock plays on Monday, there really won’t be a way to have backup plan if Hockenson sits at the last minute. You’d basically be choosing between Jesse James and Robert Tonyan in that scenario (unless you have Jimmy Graham). I’d much rather just play someone else rather than wait on Hockenson in a tougher matchup.

&nbsp;

**Rookies on Byes: RB David Montgomery, CHI, RB Josh Jacobs, OAK, RB Devin Singletary, BUF, WR Hunter Renfrow, OAK, WR Parris Campbell, IND, TE Dawson Knox, BUF, TE Foster Moreau, OAK**

&nbsp;

**Deep League Sleepers, Stashes, and Cheap DFS Options:** 

&nbsp;

**RB Jon Hilliman, NYG (Wk. 6: @NE):** With Gallman and Barkley ruled out, Hilliman is the default starting running back for the Giants this week. He doesn’t get an inviting matchup. The Patriots haven’t let any running back get into the end zone this year, and they allow the 2nd-fewest RB fantasy points per game and rank 3rd in run defense DVOA. With the game script expected to be very negative for the Giants, Hilliman will have to do work in the passing game to return a decent day. He did catch 36 passes in his last 2 college seasons despite not being a workhorse back, so he may not be a slouch as a receiver. I wouldn’t be too interested in him in redraft leagues, especially with Saquon looking like he’ll return next week, but a $3,200 price tag in DraftKings for a starting running back is at least intriguing in a GPP tournament. 

&nbsp;

**RB Benny Snell, PIT (Wk. 6: @LAC):** The Steelers only face one defense ranked higher than 23rd in run defense DVOA in their next 7 games, and Jaylen Samuels is out for a month. Samuels had been mixing in behind Conner a decent amount, and while Snell isn’t nearly as versatile as Jaylen, the Steelers are very likely to focus on running the football while Devlin Hodges is at QB. Snell should work as a change of pace back behind Conner for the coming weeks and is worth scooping up in deeper formats.

&nbsp;

**RB Reggie Bonnafon, CAR (Wk. 6: @TB):** For some inexplicable reason Jordan Scarlett is the highest priced rookie running back on DraftKings this week ($4,300) despite playing just 5 offensive snaps on the season. Anyone paying attention knows Bonnafon is the handcuff back here. Bonnafon played 11 snaps last weekend when Christian McCaffrey was dealing with cramps and he turned in a 5-80-1 line. I don’t suggest using Bonnafon this week as the Bucs rank #1 in the league in run defense DVOA. Bonnafon is worth scooping up as insurance in deep leagues if you have CMC.

&nbsp;

**WR AJ Brown, TEN (Wk. 6: @Den.):** Brown has been the epitome of boom or bust this season. He’s has more PPR points in each of his two ‘boom’ games than he does in the other 3 combined. Chris Harris Jr. is likely to shadow Corey Davis this week, which should benefit Brown. Other notable number one receivers who have faced the Broncos include Allen Robinson (4-41), Davante Adams (4-56), DJ Chark (4-44) and Keenan Allen (4-18). Number 2 receivers have fared better – Marquez Valdes-Scantling (6-99-1), Dede Westbrook (5-66) and Mike Williams (6-74). Brown is in play this week in deep leagues and in DFS tournaments.

&nbsp;

**WR Deebo Samuel, SF (Wk. 6: @LAR):** The 49ers have had one of the toughest WR groups to figure out for fantasy purposes. None of them were useful on Monday night as they blew the doors off the Browns. No receiver had more than 4 targets. This week’s game projects as more of a shootout with an over/under of 50. The 49ers should be forced to throw a little more, and the Rams rank 24th in pass defense DVOA. San Francisco has tried to manufacture ways to get the ball into Deebo’s hands, so he’s the 49er receiver I’d be most likely to take a shot on having a big game this week.

&nbsp;

**WR KeeSean Johnson, ARI (Wk. 6: vs. Atl.):** Johnson was basically a full-time player in week 5 with Christian Kirk out. Kirk might be out again this week, and Johnson was targeted 7 times in his absence on Sunday. The Falcons allow the 2nd-most WR points per game, so there is legitimate upside for KeeSean this week if Kirk sits again.

&nbsp;

**WR Jakobi Meyers, NE (Wk. 6: vs. NYG):** With Phillip Dorsett sidelined, Meyers will step in as the full time WR3 for the time being. That didn’t result in much fantasy production last week, but he should be more of a factor moving forward. If Dorsett misses several weeks Meyers should be a decent add in deep leagues. He gets a decent matchup with the Giants this week who rank 29th in pass defense DVOA. He’s basically a dart throw this week in a game the Pats should run away with.

&nbsp;

**WR Darius Slayton, NYG (Wk. 6: @NE):** Slayton doesn’t have a great matchup this week, but Daniel Jones will have to throw the ball somewhere and Slayton has been the guy he’s had the best connection with among the available options. He’s topped 11 PPR points in two of his last 3 games and costs just $100 more than the minimum on DraftKings. He has nice upside for a bottom of the barrel DFS tournament play, even in this brutal matchup.

&nbsp;

**TE Noah Fant, DEN (Wk. 6: vs. Ten.):** Fant saw his lowest target total of the season last Sunday and was outscored by teammate Jeff Heuerman, but he remained right around the same snap share that he’s been playing (66%). The Broncos got an early lead and leaned on the run game against the Chargers. This week’s matchup is one to target with tight ends. The Titans have allowed a tight end score in 4 of 5 games this year and allowed a 9-130 line to Austin Hooper in the other game. Fant is a solid TD dart throw this week.

&nbsp;

**TE Josh Oliver, JAX (Wk. 6: vs. NO):** I mention Oliver this week because the Jaguars’ starting tight end James O’Shaughnessy suffered a season-ending ACL tear this week. I wouldn’t be racing to the waiver wire to pick him up in any redraft formats, but he may be worth a flier in deep dynasty leagues, especially TE premium formats. Oliver was the team’s primary pass catcher as a senior at San Jose State last year, hauling in more than 21% of the team’s catches, and more than 22.5% of their receiving yards. Geoff Swaim and Seth DeValve are both likely ahead of Oliver on the depth chart, but Jacksonville has utilized 3 tight ends this season, and Oliver may be the best receiver of the healthy trio. DeValve had played at least 22% of the offensive snaps each of the past 3 weeks as the team’s TE3. DeValve hasn’t seen a single target this year, and Swaim has turned 15 targets into 12 catches for just 60 yards. Monitor how much Oliver is used this week. If he has an obvious passing game role, he should become a guy worth adding in redraft formats.

&nbsp;

That’s all I’ve got for this week. Hopefully it helps you with your toughest decisions involving rookies this week. Keep a close eye on the injury report this week. There are a ton of injuries that could have an impact on these outlooks – Marquise Brown, Sammy Watkins, Tyreek Hill, Saquon Barkley, Christian Kirk, Phillip Dorsett, etc. Make sure you know what injuries may affect your lineup and have a backup plan ready for Sunday. As always: Good luck, trust your gut, and have fun. It’s just a game.

1. He has multiple injuries
2. Cowboys generally get worse as weather gets colder

Misleading Position vs. Defense Rankings - Minshew Week 6,"As many likely already know, the standard Position vs. Rankings can be misleading.

I was going with the Mustache this week and he's playing the NO Saints. According to Yahoo and our QB scoring system, the Saints are 2nd worst against a QB. I didn't understand how they were considered so poor against QB's, so I looked into it. It's all rushing TD's and one terrible week against Russell.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tun0tu8kdsr31.png

The NO vs. QB's is inflated due to rushing TD's and an incredible game by Russell. I believe Minshew to be a quality QB, but this week I'm much less confident and thinking I'll go with Jimmy G.

Also, I'm working on automating a ton of stats using VBA and Excel ( \[you can see what I have right here\]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0QsofGZBASmdQL52JKgVF05lRk1CP07\_56\_gYaAaHg/edit#gid=2105506129](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0QsofGZBASmdQL52JKgVF05lRk1CP07_56_gYaAaHg/edit#gid=2105506129) ), but looking for recommendations on simplifying/visualizing the information into something more digestible. I want to weight the data and visualize using a chart, but also have the more raw information accessible to explain/understand the analysis/outcome. In the link above you can see that a lot of green in the row equals a good match-up for that team. And FYI, opp information matches to the teams opponent for this week.  Team X vs. Y, shows Y's opponent stats.

So use Vegas, Team RZ Opportunities, Opp RZ Opportunities, RZ TD's/G, Opp RZ TD's/G, RZ Rushing, RZ Passing, Team Stats, etc. And add more individual stats to the spreadsheet analysis (WR1 vs def, WR2 vs. def, SlotWR vs. Def, etc.)

This derailed, any help/suggestions are much appreciated.

TLDR: Minshew isn't as safe of a play as presented on your Fantasy Apps.

Josh Gordon is Who you Should Have Thought He Was,"Much has been made of Gordon’s disappointing beginning to the season. He’s had a couple of duds and a couple of good games through a mediocre start to his season. However, you should have seen one of these duds coming against a Buffalo defense that gave the entire Pats passing offense trouble – to the tune of keeping Brady under a completion percentage of 50% for 150 yards and an interception. The other was the only game AB played with the Pats, against a historically bad team. 


**What should you have expected from Gordon?** 

I figured a look at last year should be the frame of our expectations. I threw out three of his twelve games - one of which came with the Browns, and two of which were well below what looks to be his usual snap share of just over 80%. On a snap share of 82.44% and a target share of 18.56%, Gordon averaged 4 receptions on 6.9 targets for 70.89 yards and 0.22 TDs a game. That’s per game averages of 10.42 0.5ppr ppg. Over the course of 2018, that ranks him at WR32 for ppg in 0.5ppr, just above Mike Williams.  


**How does this compare to his four (excluding MIA) games this year?**

For starters, I threw out that Miami game – it was the only game AB played, and against the awful phins. On a snap share of 83.25% and a target share of 16.04%, Gordon has averaged 4.25 receptions on 7.5 targets per game for and average of 65.25 yards and 0.25 TDs/game. That’s 10.18 0.5ppr ppg. On the year, that average would rank him just above Christian Kirk at the #45 WR in hppr ppg. Honestly, this seems to jive pretty closely to his year last year.  


**Anything else to consider?**

Gordon’s got five red zone targets this year, compared to his seven throughout the nine games he played the majority of offensive snaps all of last year – that implies he’s being targeted in the redzone at double his pace last year. He’s tied among WRs for shares in the redzone with Edelman, and is ceding a lot of redzone work to the Patriots back-field, along with the rest of the receiving corps. 

His target share of 16.04% (excepting the MIA game) this year is down from his 18.56% from last year, and his true catch rate (adjusts for catch-able balls), per player profiler, is down from last year (75.9% vs 73.1%) – but given the number of games we’re talking about here, I’d say these differences are damn near a wash, with a little more concern about the drop in target share, but not much.  

Excluding the MIA game, Gordon’s got 303 air yards, a damn near dead-heat with Edelman (at 306), and good for ~25% of the Pats’ total and he’s second on the team in targets at 30 (vs Edelman’s 37). 


**So, what’s his outlook?**

It seems like things are standing Pat from last year, when you consider his averages are pulled down by his Buffalo game – one of his toughest match-ups of the year. There’s also encouraging possible uplift to his outlook via increased redzone targets. Gordon looks like he’s one of the top receiving options on a good offense with a HoF QB that may or may not have its ceiling limited because of favorable game scripts that lead to them drawing out possessions and clock time. His usage through his last 13ish Pats games indicates that he’s a WR3ish play, with upside to break a 15-20 point game here and there.    

Another possible indicator for upside is the fact that Gordon got absolutely fed in game 3 against the Jets when Edelman went out of the game early with his chest injury. With Burkhead and Dorsett looking to be out this game, it will be interesting to see how this affects both Gordon’s target share and his redzone usage – as well as what he does with the opportunity in a good match-up. If he gets added work here, it could be a good sign for targeting potential high-upside games down the stretch.  


**TL/DR**: 

Gordon seems to be a possible flex-play, based on match-up, and a decent bye week fill-in, with the potential for a greater work-load/floor if the Patriots are missing players due to injury. But I would hold off expecting Gordon to achieve much more than WR3 status before the end of the year. He’s bench depth with the potential for upside, but probably not a fantasy asset you need to keep a tight hold on. I’d imagine there are people out there who are still willing to chase his upside as a trade throw-in, which is probably the best place to squeeze some value right now if you don’t foresee starting him anytime soon.",121,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg502l/josh_gordon_is_who_you_should_have_thought_he_was/,1269.9753144303957,r/fantasyfootball

I've noticed that in this post (and across most posts in /r/fantasyfootball) most of the comments ask for starting advice for your roster and there are already dedicated Index articles to answer those questions. Instead focus on picking up/dropping players, ROS performance, fliers, matchup rankings, trends, etc. those will help out everyone instead of just your team. Also, the mods have locked this post before when the comments fill up with things that should go into the INDEX posts.

Patriots' Defense is overrated as Fuck,"People keep talking like they're a great defense.  Are they good?  Sure.  But, most people would be good against HORRIBLE offenses.  Who have they played this year?

Pittsburgh, with a Ben Roethlisberger who looked like shit, and couldn't throw.

Miami(enough said).

Jets(enough said).

Bills(their one standout performance, but that said... it's Josh Allen, and it's the Bills).

Washington redskins(enough said).


4/5 performances were against horrible teams, with horrible offenses.  I think some people are failing to realize... while the patriots have been very successful on D, and will probably do good ROS... they aren't some amazing defense.  It largely has to do with the fact they have one of the easiest schedules in NFL history this year.

When they play an actual offense, that's not historically bad... I would expect their cracks to show.

In-Season Adjustment (Week 6 RB),"Welcome back to the Week 6 edition of In-Season Adjustment. 

**What this is**: an attempt to predict the rest-of-season (ROS) value of players based on how they've performed given their matchups thus far and the difficulty of their remaining schedule (strength of schedule or SOS). I looked at the expected performance a player should have had given the matchups in Week 1-5 and applied that multiplier of over/under performance to the matchups they have in Weeks 6-16. 

This week I’ve added strength of schedule (SOS) for overall ROS, regular season (weeks 6-12), and playoffs (weeks 13-16). I’ve also added the number of top 10 matchups remaining in their schedule overall as well as in the playoffs. 

Some notes of caution: we are still working off a 5 game sample. These are predictions and while I hope that it will be more accurate than that of a fantasy analyst ranking ROS based on gut feel and qualitative factors, huge games can still sway the results. When making trades, get a trade that reflects the current value of the players and you should be golden, assuming you’re getting the better schedules. I find that most people do not look ahead at schedules as much as they should when evaluating a trade, take advantage of that. 

For the RB edition I also added a total TDs scored column. Because TDs have such an outsized outcome on the results (and in real fantasy) I added this so you can be aware of how TD scoring is affecting how certain players are ranked. The best example to illustrate this is Aaron Jones, he has 8 TDs leading to him being ranked #5 ROS. I would expect some regression so would not recommend buying Jones or trust the ROS rank for Jones. 

Let’s review the previous week’s recommendations. 

**Previous Week BUYs**

I said to buy Cook, Bell, and KC RBs. Of these, I missed on KC RBs. What previously looked like a decent ROS schedule has transitioned to a below average schedule. An underperformance against the Colts also led to a substantial decline in rankings. 

I cannot emphasize how much of an opportunity Bell represents with the world’s best schedule, huge usage, a returning Darnold, and only 1 TD to his name (the Jets are bad but more scoring opportunities will come with the better schedule). He had a brutal opening schedule and the owner will not be valuing him highly. After NE in week 7, it’s going to be smooth sailing.

**Previous Week SELLs**

I said to sell Kamara, David Johnson, and Mixon. None of those are misses based on the model this week. Kamara and DJ have horrible, horrible schedules with only one top 10 matchup remaining in their fantasy seasons. This week is Kamara’s last top-tier matchup and DJ’s occurs in Week 7. Get an RB with a safer schedule. 

Mixon’s schedule looks more favorable than last week, leading to a rise in the rankings. Still don’t have confidence in the Bengals O-line but his prospects are improving.

**Previous Week HOLDs**

I said to hold Zeke, Gurley, and Fournette. Of these, Gurley and Fournette are looking like good holds and Zeke is looking like a miss. I should have told you to sell but I was scared of retribution. He underperformed his matchup again. I removed Week 1 from the model where he split with Pollard and it still didn’t help him much. Like Kamara and DJ, he has a brutal ROS schedule that you want no part of. Get Zeke’s name value while you still can.

**BUY**

* Bell, Cook (from previous week)

* Josh Jacobs: Has one of the best schedules remaining, I wouldn’t pull the trigger just yet but he’s intriguing if Oakland continues to be able to run the ball. 

* SF RBs: I haven’t ranked them yet due to small sample size but they have a great regular season schedule and a team committed to running the ball. Monitor them. 

**SELL**

* Kamara, DJ, and Mixon (from previous week)

* Ezekiel Elliot: It pains me to do it but it’s unlikely to get better given the schedule and his performance thus far. He only has 2 top 10 matchups left and the next one happens Week 11 against the Lions. It’s far enough away that you’re probably maximizing trade value by cutting bait now.

**HOLD**

* Gurley and Fournette (from previous week).

Dear r/ffl - I started a service where we will take over abandoned teams for a low fee. Can I get your feedback?,"In our friendly league, it seems that at least one team stops playing by the end of the year, and it sucks for the people who are still trying. Usually the commish (me) ends up taking it over and setting their line-up every week, and then we don't let the abandoned team participate in trades. Its not much fun and its a bunch of work for the commish.

I considered using the FantasyPros autopilot tool this year, but what we really want is someone else to take over the team and play the season out - that way the other teams get to play real games against a real person, and the team can still participate in trades. Problem is, no one seems to want to take over someone else's losing fantasy team halfway through the season. Go figure.

So my friend and I are trying an experiment - we're offering to take over the abandoned teams in anyone's league for the rest of the season for $10. We put together a little website here at [FantasySaver.com](https://fantasysaver.com/?ffl) and would really appreciate your feedback. I'm a bit worried we might get ourselves in over our heads, but let's see what happens!

Week 6 TNF Matchup Guide - DFA,"#**TNF Matchup Guide**


Every week, DFA will produce a Start/Sit Strategy Guide for NFL Fantasy. We will breakdown each matchup and give valuations of each fantasy relevant player. Additionally, we will offer occasional upgrades or downgrades to specific players depending on their matchup, role in the offense, or the effect of projected game flow on a given week.


Keep in mind, one blown coverage can make a week, destroying any strategy - we are seeking to find the best odds of a players success. If you have questions about your individual lineup conundrums, you can always hit us on twitter @DFAroto!

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


NFL primetime matchups have been largely disappointing (outside of SNF and the last two TNF), and this week should be no different. Danny Dimes reverted back to normal dude **Daniel Jones (downgrade)** last week, and will be offered as human sacrifice on national television without his starting running back, backup running back, No. 1 receiver and tight end...going against the league's top rated defensive unit. It’s fully expected to be a bloodbath and the spread reflects that. Almost 60% of Jones’ target distribution is sitting out injured tonight, so rookie **Darius Slayton** and perennial backup **Cody Latimer** will be thrust into featured roles. Slayton is the preferred play as he could break a long one anytime with his blazing 4.39 speed, but both are recommended fades this week against NE’s #1 ranked secondary. **Golden Tate (upgrade PPR)** should see the training wheels taken off after only playing 46 snaps in his debut, and he’s expected to operate primarily out of the slot in the absence of **Sterling Shepard (concussion)**. Tate is a low-upside, volume based WR3 play in the tough matchup. **Rhett Ellison** is assumed to take over for **Evan Engram** tonight, but is no more than a DFS punt play. 


**RB Breakdown**


Undrafted rookie **Jonathan Hilliman** and FB **Elijhaa Penny** are expected to share the backfield tonight in the absence of **Saquon Barkley** and **Wayne Gallman**. Owners desperate for a running back could consider Hilliman due to his involvement in the passing game in what should be a very negative game-script for NY. However, doing so is an extremely desperate play that isn’t recommended. If anything, Hilliman should be stashed for next week’s game against the Cardinals, as he would become an RB2/3 if Barkley and Gallman sit again. Penny is not a recommended option in any format. 


#**Patriots**


**Opp (NYG) Pass DVOA:** #29


**Opp (NYG) Run DVOA:** #12


**Injuries to Watch DEF (NYG):** LB Lorenzo Carter (Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (NE):** WR Phillip Dorsett (Out), RB Rex Burkhead (Q, not expected to play), WR Julian Edleman (Q, expected to play), WR Josh Gordon (Q, expected to play)


**Key WR/CB matchups:** Josh Gordon vs. Janoris Jenkins (Rotoworld)


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Julian Edelman (21%), James White (20%), Josh Gordon (18%), Phillip Dorsett (15%), Rex Burkhead (12%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Sony Michel (48%, 19, 3) James White (39%, 12, 9) Brandon Bolden (13%, 6, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Patriots assault on lesser teams should continue tonight against the hapless Giants. **Tom Brady** should have plenty of chances to make up for his disappointing performance last week against one of the league's worst pass defenses - consider him a top-5 QB this week. **Julian Edelman (upgrade PPR)** continues to receive the questionable tag, but has played through his chest injury the last few weeks so he should be all systems go tonight. Consider him a WR2 with WR1 upside. **Josh Gordon** is also questionable but expected to play, and it appears that he’ll draw Janoris Jenkins in coverage. It’s not an imposing matchup, Jenkins has been destroyed by the likes of Amari Cooper, Mike Evans and John Brown this year (Rotoworld). Additionally, in the absence of **Phillip Dorsett** ‘Flash’ should assume more volume - he’s an upside WR2 play. Rookie **Jakobi Meyers** will fill in for Dorsett, but isn't an option outside of being a long shot DFS tournament play. The Patriots decided not to activate tight end **Benjamin Watson** this week after he served his four game suspension, so they will move forward with **Matt LaCosse** and **Ryan Izzo** for the time being. Neither are fantasy options. 


**RB Breakdown**


In a dream matchup last week against the Redskins, **Sony Michel** finally produced for fantasy owners, but his day was not as big as many hoped for. He’ll get another chance tonight against a porous Giants defense. He’s a back-end RB2, but could have a monster day if the Patriots run up the score, giving him plenty of goal line touches. Michel is tied for the league lead with 13 rushing attempts within the opponents 10 yard line (https://fantasyfootballers.org/rushing-red-zone-stats/), positive touchdown regression is coming. Additionally, his involvement in the passing game was a welcome surprise last week, and if it continues it would be a huge boon for his floor. **James White** should again assume most of the passing game work, but could be game-scripted out similar to last week. Consider him a solid RB2 in the expected blowout. **Rex Burkhead** is questionable but not expected to play tonight.

In-Season Adjustment (Week 6 QB),"Welcome back to the Week 6 edition of In-Season Adjustment. 

**What this is**: an attempt to predict the rest-of-season (ROS) value of players based on how they've performed given their matchups thus far and the difficulty of their remaining schedule (strength of schedule or SOS). I looked at the expected performance a player should have had given the matchups in Week 1-5 and applied that multiplier of over/under performance to the matchups they have in Weeks 6-16. 

This week I’ve added strength of schedule (SOS) for overall ROS, regular season (weeks 6-12), and playoffs (weeks 13-16). I’ve also added the number of top 10 matchups remaining in their schedule overall as well as in the playoffs. 

Some notes of caution: we are still working off a 5 game sample. These are predictions and while I hope that it will be more accurate than that of a fantasy analyst ranking ROS based on gut feel and qualitative factors, huge games can still sway the results. When making trades, get a trade that reflects the current value of the players and you should be golden, assuming you’re getting the better schedules. I find that most people do not look ahead at schedules as much as they should when evaluating a trade, take advantage of that. 

Let’s review the previous week’s recommendations. 

**Previous Week BUYs**

I said to buy Winston, Ryan, Murray, and Brissett. Of these, all have held up as buys with the exception of Brissett who moved down from rank #6 to #13 due to an underperformance at KC. Going forward, I still recommend Ryan as a strong buy and Winston and Murray as buys (but with lower conviction than Ryan). 

**Previous Week SELLs**

I said to sell Dak, Mayfield, Rodgers, and Watson. Watson is the only miss here as he has moved up to QB #5 ROS from his previous position of #12 with his huge game. I would still recommend caution with Watson as he has a below average schedule but it is actually decent for the regular season and only becomes truly bad in weeks 13-16. 

Dak may have put up decent points but his point total was in line with expected performance and he has an absolutely brutal schedule remaining (including in the playoffs). Rodgers moved up slightly but he continues to have a tough schedule remaining in the regular season, only improving for the playoffs. 

**Previous Week HOLDs**

I said to hold Mahomes and Wilson. Wilson turned in a monster performance and should be a buy if you can get him. He has one of the better schedules remaining. Mahomes is still a hold for this week but barring an absolutely massive performance, I’ll be advising you to sell next week. This week is his last top-10 matchup until Week 13, he has the worst ROS schedule and the worst playoff schedule. He’s still a great QB but you should be able to get similar performance from someone much cheaper and upgrade your team substantially at another position. 

##This Week

**BUY**

* Ryan, Winston, Murray (from previous week)

* Gardner Minshew: The model actually had him ranked as the #8 QB ROS last week and he’s only improved on that. Like most people, I didn’t rank him as a buy because I wanted to see more. He has a top tier schedule left and one of the top playoff schedules. My main concern would be whether Foles has truly lost his job (he will if Minshew’s stellar play continues). 

* Russell Wilson: A good enough schedule to be assured of consistent performance, he’s going to be great rest of season. However, you’ll have to pay full value and this analysis is more about finding unexpected value and predicting which studs are sellable due to ROS schedule. 

* Sam Darnold: Keep an eye on this situation just for the schedule. I haven’t ranked due to lack of sample size but he has one of the easiest schedules across the board.

**SELL**

* Dak, Mayfield, Rodgers (from previous week)

* Carson Wentz: He was ranked #9 but with Philly running over the Jets he turned in a disappointing fantasy day. He has the worst regular season schedule remaining, sell him now and re-buy for the playoffs. He has 3 top-10 matchups left in the schedule and they all fall in weeks 13-16. 

**HOLD**

* Patrick Mahomes: Still hold for this week but he’ll be a sell next week. Get Mahomes value while you can. He has a top 10 matchup this week against Houston but it’s tough sledding from there and an abysmal playoff schedule. Grab one of the buys and upgrade your lineup substantially elsewhere with the value you get from selling.

* Lamar Jackson: Hold for this week’s matchup. After that, sell prior to the bye or hold on and sell before the playoffs after week 11 against Houston. He gets SF, BUF, NYJ, CLE in the playoffs. None of those are top tier matchups and playing SF/BUF in your opening rounds is a recipe for disaster.

Panthers Offense Snap Counts,"So I write the snap count articles over at [FantasyAlarm.com](https://FantasyAlarm.com) and I just wanted to share this with this sub because I found it kind of interesting.  I did some write ups on the [Patriots backfield](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/d8rwii/oc_patriots_backfield_clarification/) and [Broncos backfield](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dcb16q/oc_broncos_backfield_clarification/) over the last couple weeks because they jumped out to me as well - this has caught my eye in previous weeks but just wanted to wait until the sample size was bigger.

As you know, some teams use a ton of different players and packages while others use a more concentrated group.  For instance, when healthy, the Rams use 11 personnel (3 WR, 1 RB, 1 TE) almost 90% of the time and it's almost always Cooks, Woods, and Kupp in the game for WR though they move around RBs and TEs and sometimes use Josh Reynolds.  Some teams like the Ravens use so many guys that a lot of weeks no position player plays more than 65-70% of the snaps.  For instance week 2 Marquise Brown (64.9%) and Nick Boyle (61%) were the only offensive players besides the QB and O-line to play more than 60% of the snaps.  For fantasy, you really would prefer to have both A. the snaps consolidated and B. the targets consolidated so it's easier to predict who will be out there and who will get the ball.  Makes our job much easier.

Which brings me to the Panthers this year.  In recent years, I have not seen a team use such a consolidated group of offensive players.  They are playing like it's the early 2000s where you just have your starters and they just play every play.  And it's getting more consolidated each week.

In week 4, the QB, lineman, and McCaffrey played every snap and Olsen played all but 1.  Of the starting 11, the guy who played the least was Jarius Wright and he played 70.1%.  This week DJ Moore joined them at 96.8% and Jarius Wright played 77.8%.  To put that in perspective, the starter who played the \*least\* snaps of their starting 11 this week would have had the 3rd highest snap share logged by any position player on the Ravens \*all season\*.  Only Willie Snead and Hollywood Brown played a higher snap share in week 4 alone than the Panthers 11th player.  There were 63 snaps in the Panthers game last week and the next closest guys after the top 11 were Bonnafon (who played 11 snaps because McCaffrey got a little banged up, usually he plays 0) and Ian Thomas at TE who played 11 snaps as well which is about a 17% snap share.  The only team that has come close to this at all was actually the Cowboys this week where most of their starting position players player 70-80% of the snaps and Blake Jarwin played 31% but the Panthers are doing in consistently every single week.  The Cowboys were all logging numbers in the 80% range? Week 2 the Panthers had 75 offensive snaps and CMC played 75, Samuel played 73, and Moore played 71.  Each of CMC, Moore, Samuel, and Olsen have logged at least one snap share of 97% and some of them have logged multiple.  Same 11 guys, all game, week in and week out.  Ron Rivera has his guys LOCKED in.

&#x200B;

There's no real point beyond the notion that, unlike some other teams, you don't need to guess who is going to get the snaps for the Panthers each week, even at the back end of the lineup.  It's McCaffrey, Olsen, Moore, Samuel, and Wright and that's it.  If the offense was a little better, this would be amazing for fantasy but, as of now, you obviously start McCaffrey and then you can start DJ Moore and Greg Olsen where you need them and Samuel in a pinch.  If Cam comes back healthy and is slinging it to Moore like he was (24 targets over the first two weeks) he could end up being a huge asset down the stretch.",7,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg18p3/panthers_offense_snap_counts/,1529.7086493492127,r/fantasyfootball

ESPN - Dropping Players Who Play on Thursday Night,There are a couple of players who come off of waivers tomorrow that I am interested in adding. I would probably drop Golden Tate to add one of them. Does ESPN allow you to drop players who have played on Thursday night? If not I would have to drop Tate before the game starts.,25,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg14ef/espn_dropping_players_who_play_on_thursday_night/,1537.841982714335,r/fantasyfootball
Is the waiver wire more bare than past years?,"I'm the commissioner of a 14-team half ppr superflex league (a bit of a shitshow, especially with QBs), and one of the team owners recently complained about the increased size in the league, says hes never had so little fun playing FF before because there is nothing on the waiver wire for the teams at the bottom to improve with. Just curious, have other people noticed a similar shift from past years in smaller leagues? Even with the larger league size, there are about 14 more QBs rostered, and I feel like the waivers would be bare even if it were only a 12-person league",74,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg147h/is_the_waiver_wire_more_bare_than_past_years/,1538.241982714335,r/fantasyfootball

"Week to week, do you find players like James White to be simply undroppable?","I've had him on my bench since week 1 and haven't played him once due to better options.  However every week when I go to make a waiver move I never even consider dropping him for someone on the WW.  He seems like the ultimate insurance policy.  I wanted to see if this is a sound line of thinking or if I'm too attached to a player whom I may never start the whole season?

If I'm not crazy, what other players would you consider to be everyone's handcuff?",40,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg0yyi/week_to_week_do_you_find_players_like_james_white/,1547.7419827659926,r/fantasyfootball

Rhett Ellison,"Anyone streaming him tonight? What are the expectations? Obviously NY will be down in this game and hence will need to throw the ball consistently, but there’s a lack of history with Ellison. Daniel Jones peppered Evan engram with targets, but this is obviously a different situation.

Update: Rhett ended up with 6 points in 1pt PPR, making him not a horrible play, but not good. In the end, he scored more points than Josh Gordon.",78,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg0cz5/rhett_ellison/,1591.1253161827724,r/fantasyfootball
Anyone in shallow 1QB leagues (8-10) say screw it and go with Mariota?,"Guy hasn’t thrown a pick, doesn’t throw very far either.

Which NFL players could see an increase in fantasy value if they are traded?,"Seems like the most common names in NFL trade rumor discussions are Stefon Diggs, Emmanuel Sanders, Kenyan Drake, and AJ Green. If traded, where would some of the best landing spots be for their fantasy value?

Any other fantasy-relevant players who could be traded before the Oct. 29 deadline? Or conversely, any players who could see a significant fantasy bump if a starter ahead of them was traded? (e.g. last year Hyde traded and Chubb became starter)",82,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg09en/which_nfl_players_could_see_an_increase_in/,1598.041982881228,r/fantasyfootball

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team’s matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you’re in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‘Em game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn’t give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Is there a *free resource for estimated points ROS to help compare trade values between players?,"I've seen estimated points for the season, but those were from just before week 1.  Now that we're a 5 weeks in, those values aren't necessarily a good estimate anymore.  For example, [https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections](https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections) shows AB getting 240 this year....

The perfect stats would show me the estimate points from now until week 16, full PPR.  I'd take raw stats (yds/TDs) too, and I'll score them myself.  Or even a site that shows the current estimated 2019 season total, and I'll subtract the past 5 weeks from that.  
For example: Kelce (#1) vs Kittle (#2).  That was a -20pt difference ROS if you look at 2018 stats.  Is that about the same projection for this year?

"What's the ""right way"" to run a keeper league?","This is the first year that our league decided on keepers for 2020. We are a 10 team auction league, currently running on ESPN. We decided that we can select 2 keepers this year, but we dropped the ball in terms of the finer points, which is what I am trying to sort out now.... (better late than never)??

So just looking for a little advice...

As we are an auction league, does it make sense for us to have that player cost us the same as it did this year? Would you recommend adding a nominal amount to the player's price the following year? So if CMC cost you $65 this year, does he cost you $70 if you want to keep him this year?

Is there a maximum number of years you should be permitted to keep a player?

Can you keep players that you have picked up off waivers or obtained through a trade? If so, how are those players valued?

Thanks in advance all for the sage wisdom! Good luck in week 6!",16,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfzzin/whats_the_right_way_to_run_a_keeper_league/,1616.8919831355413,r/fantasyfootball

I understand this might not be the best move for everyone, but is this a decent move for Chubb owners for insurance in case he really eats into his carries when he comes back? He's owned in 55 percent of ESPN leagues. I didn't keep up with his production last season, so I'm really not too sure what to expect out of the Browns running game once he comes back from injury/suspension.

The purpose of this piece each week is to help you with the not-so-obvious plays in good matchups that deserve some consideration, or some studs who might let you down.",525,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfyizz/week_6_start_em_sit_em/,1720.575316798687,r/fantasyfootball
Tevin Coleman Vs Matt Breida,"While looking at various rankings for this week, I was surprised so many experts have ranked Breida ahead of Coleman. Coleman is the main redzone back and will be involved in the passing game a little more.
I know he's coming off an injury but he played on Monday and had a decent amount of attempts (16).
I think Breida is still valuable, but I was curious to hear others insight on this issue.
Am I the only one who thinks Coleman is the better running back this week?",138,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfygzn/tevin_coleman_vs_matt_breida/,1724.6419834852218,r/fantasyfootball

Let's Talk About What Happens When Nick Foles Returns and What That Means for Minshew.,"The Jaguars have expressed expectations that Nick Foles will return this season. At best he can return from IR week 11.

While week 11 is a long way off, I think it certainly warrants discussion. Jacksonville clearly has a diamond in the rough with Minshew, if they end up getting a franchise QB in the sixth round then they've clearly struck gold. However, they just paid their FA QB 22 million per year with the promise that he *finally* gets to be the #1 guy on his team. Do you play the hot hand and keep going with Minshew, or give the ball back to your more experienced Super Bowl MVP?

Minshew is currently QB11 and his value is going to skyrocket with the Jags soft schedule weeks 6-9 (NO, @CIN, NYJ, HOU). The Jags then have a week 10 bye and then Foles may very well be back week 11 (@IND).

 This could potentially make Minshew a strong stash-and-flip as he is currently owned in only 54% of Yahoo leagues. QB has been a tough position this season with injuries as well as highly-touted prospects falling very short of expectations. Holding Minshew or using him to cover a bye and then flipping him to a QB needy team might be a smart move considering his schedule and uncertain future. 


So essentially the two questions are:

-Is there a real chance that the Jaguars start Nick Foles when he returns from injury? 

-Based on the answer to the above, is Gardner Minshew II a potential sell-high candidate?",131,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfxycs/lets_talk_about_what_happens_when_nick_foles/,1765.225316886107,r/fantasyfootball
"2QB and Superflex league players, are you buying Cam Newton before he returns?",Newton was doing some drills and practicing recently and looks to be coming back shortly.

Who would you say is the biggest bust this year so far and who’s the biggest steal?,"I think it’s fair at this point to start labeling players busts and steals. 5 weeks in is enough to see a pattern. Who’s the biggest bust and steal for this season? 

Excluding Antonio brown I’m gonna say biggest bust is stefon diggs

How to prevent teams from giving up?,So right now some teams are 0-5 and 1-4 and are already giving up. It’s a relatively small entry fee so it’s hard to use the financial incentives as a way to keep them in. What method have you guys been using in order to encourage people to not give up?,154,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfxide/how_to_prevent_teams_from_giving_up/,1802.1586503346762,r/fantasyfootball
Scheduling 2 games per week,"I've played in 2-4 fantasy football leagues for over 15 years and every league I've ever played in we play 2 games per week. Yet when I read posts on here I only see people talking about having records of 3-2, 4-1, etc.  Does nobody else do this?  Playing twice the # of games helps eliminate the scheduling luck factor over the course of a season. To further minimize the luck factor my dynasty league uses power rankings as standings. Thoughts? I'm just surprised it seems no one on reddit plays in leagues like this.",23,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfxfve/scheduling_2_games_per_week/,1807.8586503505708,r/fantasyfootball
Alvin Kamara owners - weeks 10-15,"I know I know, it's week 6 and no one is locked in to playoffs yet. But for those Kamara owners, what are you looking to do with him ROS despite your current record? He should get Drew Brees back ~week 10, but even with that bump are you still holding or looking to make moves for the later weeks in the season when the opponents get tougher? 

Week 10 - ATL, he should be FINE *and I'm a Falcons fan :(*
Week 11 - TB, playing very well against stud RBs
Week 12 - CAR
Week 13 - ATL again, JUICY *ruin thanksgiving*

To owners rostering Jamison Crowder - what are you doing with him this week?,"It will be Sam Darnold's first game back, against a pretty tough Dallas defense. So there is plenty of risk.

But, in the 1 game that Crowder played with Darnold this year, he had an otherworldly 14 catches on 17 targets. This is the stuff that PPR dreams are made of.

Are you guys rolling him right into your FLEX spot this week, or waiting to see how things shake out?",38,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfwpaf/to_owners_rostering_jamison_crowder_what_are_you/,1872.8253170967103,r/fantasyfootball
Mike Evans vs Panthers (James Bradberry),"So the last days I often heard, that Evans historically has bad games against the Panthers, especially against James Bradberry. Because of that I just wanted to see, if I could back that up with stats. This is the collected data of the last 3 years. (Bradberry joined the league in 2016)

https://i.imgur.com/jH1vhO0.png

I hoped for some more clear conclusions, but it is what it is. I at least wanted to share it with you. If it helps someone to decide to start him or not it was already worth it ;)

So you can see last year his results against the Panthers were much much worse compared to his stats against all other opponents. In 2016 and 2017 though that was not the case. He even performed better compared to his overall stats. This year his game against the Panthers was a bit worse compared to the other 4 games, but not much. In addition you have to have in mind he was not 100% in week 2 after his illness and only a short week to recover. Personally I am starting him this week, in fact with a least some confidence ;)",170,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfwl7k/mike_evans_vs_panthers_james_bradberry/,1884.0586504499117,r/fantasyfootball

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team’s matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you’re in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‘Em game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn’t give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you'd like to discuss something outside of this theme, please try checking the [latest Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day) for a thread that might be more suitable for you.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

Discussion: A Tale of Two Quarterbacks,"It was the crab-leggiest of times, it was the moustachiest of times. 

Jameis and Gardner are options for the QB desperate with a lotta potential.  They have a bit more pizazz than a Flacco or Garoppolo, but let's not get crazy here.  They are both on the upswing with increasing ownership.. could be good days ahead says the crowd.

Jameis did well enough against the Saints.  Minshew did great against the Panthers.  Now in week 6, they will switch opponents.. leaving one to wonder about who will have more fun this weekend.

- Is the Panthers D (Bradberry etc) that great?  Minshew and Chark devoured them.  

- Is the Saints D as bad as their stats (opposing QB fantasy production) suggest?  After Jameis put on a show vs. the Rams (respectable defense), the Saints looked pretty darn good against him for most of the game.  I think Jameis completed one of his first 5-6 passes.  

- Based on the above, do you expect Minshew to struggle as Jameis did against the Saints?

- The inverse -- is Jameis going to bodyslam the Panthers D for 5 air TDs, a rushing TD and a field goal?

QB Pass Attempts,"With week 5 in the books, the sample size is decent enough. With that in mind, here are the top 10 fantasy pass attempt leaders as you look for trades with the 0-2 win teams. Last year, having Mahomes would net you around 90 points more than the average in a 12 man league. Matt Ryan and Ben Roe would get you around 20. That’s across the season. You’re looking for TD upside and a reliable 200 yards a game. If you have Mahomes, you get both of these. 

So Mahomes threw for:

383/580 5097y 50TD:12INT.

He scored 4 more points per game than Matt Ryan, the runner up. 

Through 5 weeks, Mahomes had (passing only):

112/176 1513y 14:0

Through 5 weeks 2019: 

**Jared Goff:**

140/222 1649 7:7

**Matt Ryan:**

156/222 1655 11:7

**Andy Dalton:**

129/204 1412 7:4

**Kyler Murray:**

126/201 1324 4:4 (2 rush...ok sorry)

**Patrick Mahomes:**

128/195 1831 11:0

**Philip Rivers:**

133/194 1465 7:4

**Deshaun Watson:**

110/159 1364 11:1

**Rayne Prescott:**

119/171 1606 11:6

**Lamar Jackson:**

106/162 1271 11:5 (only 1 rush, I know you’re thinking it)

Hope it helps. As you can see, some dudes are on pace to throw A LOT. There’s a decent chance we get several QBs in striking distance of Mahomes’ 2018 total on account of way more pass attempts.",20,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfs7nt/qb_pass_attempts/,2359.1086507995924,r/fantasyfootball
Week 6 #FF Streamers,"Raise your hand if you were blown out last week! Sheesh, that's a lot of hands. If you raised your hand, don't worry! A loss is a loss no matter how you slice it, but it's a new week. It's time to redeem yourself and get back on track!

In this article, I'm going to highlight 2 top streamers per position in deep and shallow leagues along with BONUS streamers to consider if the highlighted players are already taken in your league. (Per Yahoo)

QB

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Jimmy Garoppolo (59% owned) at Chiefs

It doesn't get any safer than Jimmy G. He barely qualifies for this post since his ownership is hovering around 60% (and is sure to go up), but he needs to be mentioned as a potential streamer. This week he goes on the road to face the LA Rams, who have been giving up a ton of points lately. I expect this to be a high-scoring game, where both teams are going to have to THROW to keep up with each other. I expect Garoppolo to crack AT LEAST the Top-15 this week. 
Other QBs to consider streaming: Gardiner Minshew II (25% owned) vs Saints, Kirk Cousins (41% owned) vs Eagles


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Sam Darnold (13% owned) vs Cowboys

Making his long-awaited return from mono, Darnold is back and fully healthy. He's coming back to an offense that boasts a lot of skilled position players in Le'Veon Bell, Robby Anderson, Jamison Crowder, and Chris Herndon. There might be some rust to shake off coming back from the illness, but I expect the talent around him to help him overcome the rust. Start him in a DEEP league with confidence. 
Other QBs to consider streaming: Marcus Mariota (14%) at Oak, Teddy Bridgewater (9%) at Jax

RB

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Kenyan Drake (56% owned) vs Redskins

Let me preface this by saying, the running back pool below 60% ownership is BRUTAL. The show must go on, though! I expect Drake to deliver serviceable FLEX numbers in a competitive game between two tanking teams. He has clearly earned the trust in this offense over Ballage, and he will be relied upon to move the ball down the field.
Other RBs to consider streaming: Adrian Peterson (47%) at MIA, Rex Burkhead (27%) vs NYG


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Chase Edmonds (5% owned) vs Falcons

If I thought RBs under 60% ownership was brutal, I spoke TOO soon. If David Johnson misses this week, he becomes a legitimate RB2. If Johnson plays then Edmonds is a complete dart throw. He should be used as a second or third flex in a DEEP league just in case he gets extra work with Johnson clearly ailing. 
Other RBs to consider streaming: Ito Smith (15%) at Ari, Giovani Bernard (11%) at Bal

WR

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

DK Metcalf (57% owned) at Browns

When you combine a 6'3 230lb. physical specimen who runs a 4.33 40 yard dash with the efficiency of Russell Wilson, that person becomes a weekly streamer. Despite the tough matchup, I expect Metcalf to be the recipient of a few deep passes, and if he hits on one of them, you have yourself an automatic low-end WR2/high-endWR3.
Other WRs to consider streaming: Mohamed Sanu (42%) at Ari, Jamison Crowder (43%) vs Dal


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

DeVante Parker (9% owned) vs Redskins

Parker is walking into a juicy matchup this week against the Redskins. On the season, he is averaging 6 targets a game. Competitive games are tough to come by for the Dolphins these days, but when a favorable matchup comes around, you need to pounce. Parker could be a sneaky DEEP league flex play. 
Other WRs to consider streaming: Marquise Goodwin (19%) at LAR, Preston Williams (8%) vs WSH

TE

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Gerald Everett (12% owned) vs 49ers

Despite being owned in only 12% of Yahoo leagues, Everett needs to be picked up everywhere and streamed this week in a plus matchup vs the 49ers. He has been coming on strong lately being targeted 20 times over the past two games. He is becoming a key part of this high-octane offense, and I'm picking him up and starting him this week. I'm expecting Top-12 numbers from Everett this week. 
Other TEs to consider streaming: Chris Herndon (30%) vs SF, Jason Witten (54%) at NYJ


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Noah Fant (13% owned) vs Titans

The Tight End pool becomes extremely thin below 20% ownership, but Fant is a player I'm taking a shot on this week if I'm desperate in a DEEP format. He has all the tools of being a stud fantasy TE for years to come, and the Broncos have been willing to look his way this year to the tune of 3-4 targets per game. I'm expecting the same amount of targets this week and expecting low-end TE2 production. 
Other TEs to consider streaming: Vernon Davis (14%) at Mia, Jordan Akins (7%) at KC

DEF

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Carolina (41% owned) at Buccaneers 

The Panthers have been a Top-5 defense on the year, and they get to face Jameis Winston and the Buccaneers. Expect a few turnovers with a medium amount of points. 
Other DEFs to consider streaming: Denver (29%) vs Ten, Seattle (49%) at Cle

Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Washington (4% owned) at Dolphins

The theme of the year is to stream any defense going up against the Dolphins, right? Might as well keep that train moving here this week, if you're desperate. 
Other DEFs to consider streaming:  Miami (0%) vs Was, Atlanta (3%) at Ari

K

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Jake Elliot (54% owned) at Min

The Eagles high-flying offense visits the Vikings this week, and I expect Carson Wentz to move the ball well but struggle to capatilize in the red zone from time-to-time.
Other Ks to consider streaming: Josh Lambo (39%) vs NO, Mike Nugent (26%) vs NYG

Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Zane Gonzalez (17% owned) vs ATL

Zane Gonzalez is criminally under-owned. He plays for a fast pace, high-flying offense that finds themselves in the red zone consistently and failing to cash in on touchdowns. I expect Zane to see a few FGs in this game, giving him a solid floor. 
Other Ks to consider streaming: Dan Bailey (10% owned) vs Phi, Brandon McManus (5%) vs Ten

The Community is low on Kirk Cousins this week. I'm starting him and I feel fine.,"Cousins has been a disappointment this year, not just for people that thought he would be a startable top 12ish QB, but for those that spent early picks on Diggs and Thielen thinking they were getting a top 12 WR.

I know Zimmer wants to run run and run some more but I think week 4 was a breaking point for this offense. Diggs wanting out, Thielen telling the media they need to throw more. Cousins went out and did what was expected against the Giants and finally had a good fantasy day. I get it, the Giants D stinks. So now coming off of what could possibly be a turning point for this offense, against another defense that has struggled to slow anyone down we are staying away from Cousins?

I know the Eagles defense just shut down the Juggernaut Jets with future HOF'er Nick Faulk (Folk? who cares) so their numbers against opposing QB's are going to look a little beefy after week 5. I'm not getting fooled by this. This is the same defense that let Case Keenum throw for 380 and 3 TD's in week 1. Additionally Cousins has 8 career games against the Eagles and is averaging 302 yards and 2.25 TD's a game.

I'm not saying he's a top 5 option but I think the community is dismissing him in favor of guys like Kyle Allen and Baker Mayfield. All I'm saying is if you were savvy enough to stream him last week and Minshew or Stafford aren't on the waiver wire, don't panic. Just bust open some grape soda, throw on some Creed and let it ride for one more week. It's all good man.",65,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfrg7q/the_community_is_low_on_kirk_cousins_this_week_im/,2428.025317498048,r/fantasyfootball

Below is a link of the logo's to the league if you want to check them out.  All I ask is that I have full creativity as exact requests will be tough.  Give me your team name and I'll take it from there.  If you have something you're dying for let me know and if I have extra time or it's not intense I'll give it a go.

I will be making these in order that the request came in. If your logo request is racist, dumb, makes no sense, requires a lot of custom work or is very similar to another users than it will be skipped.

If you want to use a logo created but with your team name reply to the imgur post for that logo with your team name and I’ll make it.

These are going to take a while but I’ll do my best to get them done.

How to use Fantasy Points Against D/ST,"Hi everyone, attempting to get a better understanding of how team defenses work  to make a calculated decision on which IDP players could  hit 15+ points any given week instead of blindly picking ""Most Fantasy Points"" . Appreciate any help 

Through 5 weeks, NYJ (23), TEN ( 22), ARI (21), CIN (20), TB and MIA (18) are the teams that have allowed the most sacks to opposing D/ST's. NYJ number is even crazier because they've only played 4 games. 

15.5 of 23 sacks NYJ have allowed came from Defensive Ends, TEN 12 of those 22, but ARI gave up their 13/21 sacks NOT to Defensive Ends but to LB's (only 6 of the sacks ARI has allowed went to DE position).

 Anyways my question is, is there a reason why The Cardinals are getting sacked so much by LB's and the Jets and Titans are being sacked by a majority of DE's in such an inverse amount?Does this have to do with the QB play of Kyler Murray?  Also Which OL position  are at fault (if any) for allowing all those sacks to come from LB or DE? I'm trying to understand the game more and get that this is a question that would annoy some so i apologize for the ""noob"" feel of it.Total Fantasy Points"" always have  Van Der Esch, Martinez, Schobert at the top,  but if I'm understanding the trend correctly when playing the JETS pick DE over LB for a possible sack, FF and maybe if lucky a TD. If anyone could shed some light and explain why this would be I'd greatly appreciate it !

Thank you!",6,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfpvyc/how_to_use_fantasy_points_against_dst/,2556.8253176848093,r/fantasyfootball
Kyler Murray - A Sleeper?,"Bear with me here... I'm not sure what his ownership average is in the average sized league, but I got him off the waiver wire last week. Here are some statistics that suggest he has plenty more upside than we've seen:

\- If we take his average rushing yards for the first 5 games of the season we get 659 yards. Only 13 QB's have rushed for over 659 yards in the history of the NFL

\- If we take the average of his most recent 3 games, he's on pace for 1008 yards. The only quarterback to do that in history is none other than Mike Vick. Keep in mind i'm NOT trying to compare him to Vick, nor am I saying that he's going to maintain his rushing pace, but it is a statistic to keep note of.

\- He's 8th overall for fantasy QB's this season as a rookie. This isn't exactly the unique part however - the unique part is that he's only thrown 4 touchdowns thus far. Being able to throw to Kirk and Fitzgerald suggests this number can only increase in the future, strictly based on their pedigree.

\- His only passing TD's were against two respectable defences: Detroit & Carolina.

\- He is only second to Lamar Jackson in rushing yards by QB's. Furthermore, he is ahead of James Connor, Devonta Freeman & Duke Johnson in rushing yards to name a few.

I know this analysis isn't crazy in depth, I just created it to give you an idea of why he's worth rostering in most leagues. Don't take everything I said as you HAVE to get him at all costs, I just figured I'd give him the credit he hasn't quite gotten yet. Good luck this season!",46,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfplh0/kyler_murray_a_sleeper/,2580.558651034037,r/fantasyfootball

Why You Should Buy: Kenny Golladay,"Five weeks into the season, and I think we have some real data - time to start making some sharp trades!

-Deep Diving on one player at a time to help keep comments/questions on topic, I realize this is a lengthy post - I hope you find it useful. 


**Starting point — Magic numbers.**
2018s Top 12 WRs, all but 4 WRs had **150+ Targets AND 100+ Rec.**
(the 4 others all had 130ish targets and 85ish Rec)

Why these matters - I maintain that **9+ targets a game** is the elite (aka WR1) threshold.

—2019 WRs with 9+ targets/game so far:

Cooper Kupp
Michael Thomas
Keenan Allen
Tyler Boyd
Michael Gallup*
Sammy Watkins
Robert Woods
Christian Kirk
Kenny Golladay
Desean Jackson*
Davante Adams
————
(8.8 targets / game)
Julio Jones 
DeAndre Hopkins
Larry Fitzgerald

**The Situation**
First let’s remove *Gallup and DeSean Jackson* - they have missed games which affects their averages. Watkins benefitted from Hill missing 4 weeks (in which Watkins still didn’t produce) 

———
Of the WRs left, Kupp, Thomas, Julio, Hopkins, and Adams are going to be nearly impossible to get from their owners (at least not on the cheap)

**The Candidates:** 
Keenan Allen, Tyler Boyd, Christian Kirk, Kenny Golladay, Robert Woods and Larry Fitzgerald. 

**All of these guys may be good acquisition targets,** and we can discuss them more later, but very quickly why Golladay is the best VALUE imo:

- Keenan Allen still has the name/reputation, making him more expensive. They also got MG3 back which changes things, and lost some O-linemen recently.

- Robert Woods is at best the 3rd option on LAR, and has 0 TDs through 5 games. I don’t think that’s a fluke. 

- Larry Fitzgerald has grey hands, but also has to deal with a rookie QB, rookie coach, weak O-line and is more of a possession receiver. 

- Christian Kirk, see Fitzgerald above - except he’s also not a Hall of Famer yet...

- Tyler Boyd may be the second WR I’d target (can make a separate post for him if people like) - though his QB is the consistently inconsistent Andy Dalton plus a bad O-line as well. While he may be a good buy target, AJ Green MAY return and change things.


**Finding Value**
We always talk about “buy low”. I think Golladay’s stock is depressed — paying “current fair market price” is NOT same as lowballing - I want Him on my team!

—Here is the case for buying Kenny Golladay—

+ Elite size/speed combination with talented hands and body control. 

+ Elite Redzone target - out of all the guys in this post (*including* the “expensive” WR1s) he’s the **ONLY one** averaging 1.0 TDs/game after 4+ games. 

+ Currently averaging ELITE targets (9.0) **BUT only** 4.6 Rec / game (this is due to one game of 2 rec of 8 &lt;- this is where we find value!

+ Undisputed #1 WR on his team

+ Above average, Veteran QB (Stafford had Megatron for years) 

+ Already had his bye week


**Conclusion**
In my experience (especially these days on Apps) Most people don’t sort/look by Avg per week stats. 

This, along with the bye and a down week 3 makes Golladay’s OVERALL scores look pedestrian:

He’s WR20ish in points (depending on format, PPR even lower) which is a *market inefficiency* and a buying opportunity. 

**TLDR**
I would gladly pay a WR20-25 price for a super talented receiver who I think will finish as WR12+. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him inside the Top 10.

Hope this was helpful, at the very least thought provoking! Happy to hear comments.",314,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfp3a7/why_you_should_buy_kenny_golladay/,2621.275317831834,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Evening, 10/09/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Chiefs RBBC,Haven’t seen a post game discussion on the rbs. Anyone have thoughts on this backfield based on the game?

"Alright, Digg This","So Diggs is making his owners upset, with his low end points and just not showing up. also Kirk Cousins is not helping the owners out at all. BUT, hear me out. There is a good chance that diggs (and likely thielen) break out this week. Minnesota play the eagles this week. This is a great time to start diggs. Philidelphia are great against the run. allowing an average 19.1 points in PPR, on the other hand they allow an average of 45.7 points in PPR to WR.  Also Wentz is a lot better than chase daniels and trubisky. So theres a higher chance Cousins has to sling it.

so this gives our boys diggs and thielen a chance to pop off. Dalvin will still eat im sure, but Diggs and thielen will be the ones to have a great game.

"Does your league reward overall points or just the ""Super Bowl"" winner?","I'm commissioner of two leagues.  The older of the two (going back almost 20 years) has always paid the overall high points winner the larger share of the pot (40% compared to 30% for the Super Bowl).  It's a league of sharps and the stakes are relatively high.  We use real $ for FAAB so if you bid $100 on Galman, you pay $100.   

For the younger of the two leagues which is much lower stakes, I tried to set up a similar pay-out structure and the other owners acted as if I was the craziest thing they'd ever heard of.  This struck me as odd considering total # of points is a much better measure of a team's strength, draft, and roster management whereas the Super Bowl is oftentimes won by an otherwise inferior team.  BTW - not advocating that the Super Bowl winner doesn't get paid - but I think 40%/30% split makes sense.",58,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfn9qh/does_your_league_reward_overall_points_or_just/,2752.1919848839443,r/fantasyfootball

Reddit Consensus Positional Rankings [Week 6] (Supplemental Voting Post),"**The original post of this is on Tuesday, but I like to repost it again Wednesday to garner as many eyes on this post meaning more votes for the consensus rankings, making them a more true consensus of what this sub reddit thinks.**

For those that have never seen these posts before, its a pretty simple concept.  
**1.** Each week I'll create a post on Tuesday morning which will link to 4 voting polls, 1 for each of the following positions QB,RB,WR,TE.   
**2.** Each poll will consist of a list of players at that specific position (18-20 for QB & TE polls) and (40-50 for RB & WR polls).  
**3.** The poll will automatically generate a random match-up between 2 of the players from that position, and ask you simply ""Who will perform better in PPR this week?"".  
**4.** All you have to do is choose who you personally think will perform better, ie ""Score More Fantasy Points"".  
**5.** The Polls are never ending and will continue to generate random 1vs1 match-ups until you eventually exit out.   

**To Contribute toward this effort all I ask is that you spend a few minutes to open up each of the following polls and just vote on a handful of generated match-ups, helping create a more true consensus of /r/fantasyfootball**   

[**RB POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/RBrankingsWeek62019 )  

[**WR POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/WRrankingsWeek62019 )  

[**QB POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/QBrankingsWeek62019 )  

[**TE POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/TErankingsWeek62019 ) 

*The idea is to gather as many users from this sub as possible all contributing toward the poll by answering a few ""match-ups"" for each positional poll to gain a consensus rankings that will be posted each Thursday. The ranks allow people that are constantly asking ""start/sit"" questions between two players at the same position to garner the consensus opinion (in ranking form) of the entire sub, vs having maybe 1 to 2 people if that answer their roster decision on the daily index posts. I also will have them compared to the Fantasy Pros Experts' Consensus Ranks when I post the results on Thursdays allowing for the sub to see where we might be high or low in comparison on certain players.*",0,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfmcme/reddit_consensus_positional_rankings_week_6/,2818.0753183484076,r/fantasyfootball

terrible pun about mixon,"I wanted to try and write out my thoughts for mixon this week and hopefully start a discussion on the viability of starting him. Let me know if I missed anything or got something wrong, took the stats from ESPN.

**Pros:**

* talent
* baltimore's defense has been vulnerable to RB's, looking at their past schedule:
   * *week 1* @MIA: 0 TD, 12 yds. dolphin bad and the ravens  have destroyed their week 1 opponent the past few years
   * *week 2* vs ARI: 1 TD, 16 yds. worth noting DJ was banged up this game.
   * *week 3* @KC: 1 TD, 124 yds. McCoy + Darrel were solid.
   * *week 4* vs CLE: 4 TD, 192 yds. Chubb is pretty good.
   * *week 5* @PITT: 1 TD, 57 yds. Rudolph almost died (not that their pass attack differed too much after, Hodges might've actually pushed it down the field better). Regardless, 55 + a TD is a respectable day
   * u/issue9mm provided some info about adjustments made by the ravens D after they got Chubbed. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfm7iq/terrible\_pun\_about\_mixon/f346p3v?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfm7iq/terrible_pun_about_mixon/f346p3v?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
* improved YPC the past 3 weeks (>4.0) compared to weeks 1-2 (<2)

**Cons:**

* probability of a negative gamescript considering baltimore's offense
* road game for cincy
* poor RZ rush efficiency = 0/10 (only TD was receiving)

**Additional factor to consider:**

* Potential O-line adjustments: bengals fans would know better than me but I read that they were shifting Price inside and having a competition at LT (Jerry vs Redmond). Unsure of how that exactly will affect Mixon but it can't get much worse right?

&#x200B;

The fact that the ravens have conceded a rushing TD every week besides Miami has me cautiously optimistic about Mixon this week. Obviously this is all dependent on roster construction and league size.

Anyone in 2QB leagues considering streaming Kyle Allen for this week?,"TB seems like it's behind only Atlanta and Miami in terms of being an absolute sieve for passing. They let Goff put up 40 points, and they just made Bridgewater look like the second coming of Brees. 

Allen seems like he's not afraid whatsoever to air it out, and with how badly CMC got shut down a few weeks ago in the same matchup, Riverboat Ron seems like he'll be gameplanning specifically to attack TB through the air as much as possible now that he isn't hobbled by an injured Cam Newton. I know Tampa's D-line is much improved, but Carolina's O-line has been playing well, and you have to trust that they'll use bubble screens and wheel routes to avoid Allen getting blown up.

Any Josh Allen/Carr/Brisset owners have any thoughts about this matchup? Or are you already all set with your backup?",44,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfkqgn/anyone_in_2qb_leagues_considering_streaming_kyle/,2931.9253187338513,r/fantasyfootball

Sources for data on DST predictions?,"Here's the basic question: After 4 or 5 games, do the top DST teams persist for the remaining season?

More subtle question: Which elements of the DST scoring are most persistent, and which have the highest variance? My hunch is that sacks, fumble recoveries and interceptions are more stable over time, while TDs, points against and safeties have more variance. Optimal strategy would likely be to look, after the first 4 or 5 weeks and find teams that perform well on the elements that are likely to persist.

Anyone know 1.) if this analysis has been done before, and if so, where to find it? and if not, 2.) Where could I get the data to actually look at this myself?",7,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfklyp/sources_for_data_on_dst_predictions/,2941.058652083079,r/fantasyfootball

2 Flex players should be standard in most leagues,"I can see why you wouldn't want a second flex in a 16 or even 14 team league, but there should always be a second flex option in 12 team leagues or less. If you were someone lucky enough to draft very well and made solid pickups (Chark for example) you may be stuck having to choose between 2-3 easily startable players for your 1 flex. You should have the chance to play all of your good players and be rewarded for having good depth on your bench. It gives you more options for strategy, like playing one ""floor"" player, and one boom/bust type player.",63,0.32,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfkagr/2_flex_players_should_be_standard_in_most_leagues/,2963.8419854680697,r/fantasyfootball

Is Zay Jones worth a pre waivers add?,"With the Zay Jones trade to Oakland news yesterday, seems like really nobody wants to touch the guy unless they have to. Of course, that's mostly because of his inconsistent WR3 production in the past and some bad drops, but if they came out and said he was going to be the WR2 on the team, would you pick him up just to see?

&#x200B;

ZJ obviously came in with high draft stock, and though he never lived up to it yet it seems like the Raiders have high hopes here. Gruden is using the bye to train him, and Mayock, a former draft analyst, actually ranked him as the #4 reciever in the 2017 draft, above JuJu and Kupp. Clearly, that was wrong, but it seems like ZJ is going to have a lot of support coming into the team. 

&#x200B;

Add that to Tyrell Williams dealing with injuries all year, JJ Nelson out last week and not productive on the year, Renfrow not super productive either, it looks like Zay Jones might be walking into a starting job here. You'd also think most teams are focused on stopping Tyrell and Waller, and not giving up big runs to Jacobs. 

&#x200B;

If you're hurting at WR right now, or have a bench spot you use for weekly dart throws, I think Zay Jones might be a great option.",25,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfk7mi/is_zay_jones_worth_a_pre_waivers_add/,2969.5086521704993,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Afternoon, 10/09/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you'd like to discuss something outside of this theme, please try checking the [latest Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day) for a thread that might be more suitable for you. If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

Assuming health: Kelce, Ertz, Kittle, Engram, Waller, Hooper, Andrews, Dissly, Hockenson, Herndon, and Henry are all guys I could potentially be happy with having as my tight end. And there will likely be another guy or 2 who emerges who could be had off waivers.

Dede Westbrook could be a sneaky good play this week.,"Last week, Marshon Lattimore held Mike Evans to 0 catches, while Chris Godwin thrived with 7 catches on 9 targets, for 125 yds and 2 TDs.

This week, DJ Chark will likely be covered by Lattimore, leaving Dede Westbrook with the softer coverage.

The volume is there for Dede: He's averaging almost 9 targets per game in the last three weeks. At a minimum, this gives him a safe floor, especially in PPR leagues.

The Saints defense is elite against the run and will likely force Minshew to rely on his arm.

Finally, the Saints have allowed the 6th most fantasy points to opposing teams' WRs (standard scoring).

For teams that need bye week fill-ins, it seems as though a lot of stars are aligning for Dede Westbrook. But if you disagree, please tell me why!

[Speculation] Is there a possibility that the Browns would hire Jay Gruden for an OC/HC capacity?,"No news or anything but I'm just thinking, watching the Browns this year they obviously have a lot of talent at the skill position and are vastly underperforming compared to expectations.  I'm in the camp that Baker in fact is not the worst starting QB this year and while he's overhyped, he's also not a trash QB.

This week vs SF, the Browns had multiple occasions of putting a TE (Demetrius Harris) to block Nick Bosa.  This is obviously a big mismatch and a reason why Bosa just destroyed the Browns O Line.  While this was a problem, it also seems like a pretty easy scheme problem to fix (let's NOT line the 230lb TE who was never all that great at blocking against the 2nd overall pick who's 266lbs and has a job to destroy our QB).

Jay Gruden, despite recent issues, has always been a pretty good OC bringing out a respectable performance out of his offense in WAS even though he was often saddled with bad players and/or injuries.  Wouldn't it just make sense for the Browns to go out and hire him and see what might happen?  Has something like this ever happened before where a HC gets fired and is hired into another team within a few weeks?",20,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfisyo/speculation_is_there_a_possibility_that_the/,3068.5253193974495,r/fantasyfootball

V1per's Week 6 Survivor/Eliminator Pick,"Whelp, it happened. KC lost last week. That's just the way it goes sometimes. However, the show must go on! I know several of you on here didn't pick KC for a variety of reasons, or are in leagues that allow 1 loss or more losses, so the posts will continue.

Also, the downloadable excel file is available at the bottom to enter your own teams and run it for yourself.

**I don't care about stupid math stuff, just give me the team**

Fine. New England Patriots.

Our favorite teams to pick against -- Miami & Washington are playing each other this week, and Arizona is playing a bad Falcons team at home. This limits our choices a bit.

The top teams to consider this week are the Patriots (-16.5), Ravens (-11.5), Chargers (-7), and Cowboys (-7). Since I've already picked the Ravens and Cowboys, looks like we are going with the Patriots.

**Season so far**

4-1. 

KC had an 84% chance to win last week, and let us all down. I still stand by the fact that they were the correct choice (after-all if you picked NE last week, who would you pick now?). That's the way games of chance and probability work. We can only pick the teams that gives us the best chance of winning and hope to avoid the upset.

**Season Long Outlook**

Teams in italics are changes from last week. This is simply to give some insight into why team X or Y aren't being picked this week. It's usually because they are better off being used later in the season, or it's because I've already used them.

&#x200B;

|Week|Team|P(Win)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|PHI|100%|
|2|BAL|100%|
|3|DAL|100%|
|4|LAC|100%|
|5|KC|0%|
|6|NE|92%|
|7|BUF|87%|
|8|NO|86%|
|*9*|*HOU*|*69%*|
|10|IND|87%|
|11|SF|83%|
|12|CLE|84%|
|13|CAR|82%|
|14|GB|85%|
|15|NYG|75%|
|16|SEA|84%|
|17|LAR|85%|

&#x200B;

 The only change is the week 9 pick. We're now swapping out the Jets with Houston after Houston's impressive win last week. This is looking like the hardest week to get through right now and will likely change again before week 9.

The rest of the picks are against teams that are looking increasingly bad. Outside of a team collapsing I expect very little movement on the remaining teams rest of season.

**Nerdy Math Stuff**

P(Win out) = 10.8%

E(Wins) = 13.99 (-0.78)   -- Yup, I'm expected to lose two more games this year

**Methedology**

I get team win percentages from 538 for every game in the entire season. I update probabilities for the current week based on Vegas betting lines to better take into account current team situations that 538's computer models can't account for.

With all of these values, I run something called the Hungarian Algorithm which solves the best possible choices to maximize the total win percentage values. This makes sure to use each team when it's optimal to do so.

The method used for this maximizes your chance of making it through the whole season undefeated. This is ideal if you are in a very large (70+ person) league. If however, you are in a small league that is unlikely to have everyone make it to the end and the last person standing is the winner, than the above picks will be less than ideal. If you're in one of these smaller leagues, download the file below, enter your league size and get the team list specifically for your league.

**Download**

After getting a lot of ""What if I picked teams A and B already?"" or ""What if there are only 20 people left in my league?"" or ""What if I can only pick teams that play on Sunday?""

I got you covered. I cleaned up the sheet and added a couple of features that should work for everyone.

You can download it from [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/file/weaecfmprbe6hv4/NFL_Survivor.xlsm/file).

"Past League Winners, success in constantly streaming? (outside of D/ST, K, IDP)","Hi everyone, sitting at 4-1, .5ppr 12 man league. To give you an idea of how thin I am at TE, I played Eifert this week (didn’t lose this week) but the week before that was Doyle, and before that Ebron, then I think it was Doyle as well. Past league winners, any of you found success just streaming TE or even QB constantly throughout the season? I’m talking  at least more than half the season streaming said position. Or did you have a set TE , QB by at least week 6-7? It would be great to pick up someone on waivers who will breakout so I can just set it and forget, but also not going to be too upset if I keep winning without a TE I can trust. I just don’t know how long streaming a vital offensive position can be effective in the long term/winning the championship.",18,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfimis/past_league_winners_success_in_constantly/,3081.441986167431,r/fantasyfootball
Wentz owners should pick up Sam Darnold,"Looking a few weeks ahead, the schedule for Wentz doesn't look great:

| Week | Team | Rank vs QB |
|---|---|---|
| Week 8 | @ BUF | 3 |
| Week 9 | vs CHI | 6 |
| Week 10 | BYE | - |
| Week 11 | vs NE | 1 |

Compare this to mono-free Darnold's schedule:

| Week | Team | Rank vs QB |
|---|---|---|
| Week 8 | @ JAX | 14 |
| Week 9 | @ MIA | 32 |
| Week 10 | vs NYG | 26 |
| Week 11 | @ WAS | 27 |

Sure, Darnold has a lot to prove still, but the schedule differences are significant, and Wentz has had a couple of bad outings already. And another part of my support of Darnold *was* due to the return of Chris Herndon...so of course news comes out as I'm writing this that Herdon injured his hamstring. Hopefully he'll be healthy by Week 8.

**But what if Darnold is not available?**

Darnold has only 7.6% ownership on ESPN, so he should be available. Even if not, he may be dropped before or after his Week 7 matchup vs New England.

I'm not an expert...just a dude who likes comparing stats, so feel free to let me know if I'm missing any details that would make this a bad move.

EDIT- I'd like to emphasize that this move is better suited to Wentz owners **who have little other options available.** Darnold is a free agent in 92% of ESPN leagues, and has an enticing schedule compared to other likely free agents. If you already have a quality backup, of course I would rank those guys above Darnold.",27,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfikid/wentz_owners_should_pick_up_sam_darnold/,3085.3919861833256,r/fantasyfootball

Stop trying to make OJ Howard happen. It's not going to happen.,"Making this post because I'm tired of reading his name this far into the season. I'm sorry you 100% wasted a draft pick on him. I really am, but it's time to get real with yourselves and just accept it: he's flat-out droppable. He's been droppable since week 3. He's on the lowest tier of TE's and you are wasting very valuable bench space holding on in the hopes of him ""breaking out."" That isn't happening. Sure, he might have a decent week or two but he's just not who everyone thought he would be this season. 

Here's the thing: you were chasing his value from the past few seasons, which is understandable, but his value has left town. His value has moved to Atlanta. His value was in Dirk Koetter, who loves throwing to TE's. You only *thought* you wanted OJ Howard, but in reality you wanted Austin Hooper. 

So do yourself a favor, right now, and go to your roster and drop him. Drop him for anyone. Hell, for no one. It doesn't matter. Just drop him and feel the weight immediately lift off your shoulders. You're welcome.

tl;dr- He's a bum this year and you need to drop his bum ass, like a month ago.",348,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfhuqd/stop_trying_to_make_oj_howard_happen_its_not/,3137.1086529334384,r/fantasyfootball

What do you look for in a fantasy podcast?,"Hey y’all! 

Currently I am working on a podcast with some friends and are trying to solidify a solid schedule/format. 

Right now we can only do one episode weekly, but we cover all matchups heading into Sunday and cast our projections and give reasons to why we think what we do.

So, I want to know what people look for - if you like more of a thorough, cover all of the matchups type podcast that goes over 2 hours, or just a quicker hitting “we know who we’re starting, give us studs and duds” kind of podcast?

Thanks in advance!

Been seeing different opinions on this topic, mainly I'm talking about Rb handcuffs.

I have drafted both Gordon and ekeler this year and it worked out nicely for me so far especially with Gordon back now.

Gordon and ekeler or Gordon and Coleman may be my starters but if Gordon or Coleman go down I have good opportunity with their backups.

Five of the top 15 WRs this season have scored more fantasy points in one game than all their other games combined (non-ppr),"Meanwhile, zero of the top 15 RBs have done that.

The WRs: Evans, Fuller, Watkins, M. Brown, J. Ross

As a big believer that running backs win fantasy championships, I think this season is a good illustration of why. Not only have even the best WRs been inconsistent (Keenan Allen almost made this list as well), but you see a lot of unexpected names on that top 15 list (including Chark and Sutton). As for running backs, it is pretty much the guys you would expect to be there given injuries and hold outs and they are much more consistent week-to-week. 

I know “zero RB” is very in vogue but I think there is something to say for how powerful the position is when the good guys stay healthy.",303,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfgsfb/five_of_the_top_15_wrs_this_season_have_scored/,3220.9419865171117,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Morning, 10/09/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

London games,"The bucs and panthers are playing in London this week and last week we saw again that the early arrival of a team in the UK is useful as the bears, who arrived on Friday, looked tired against a raiders team that spent basically the entire week in London as they left the USA right after their win against the colts in week 4.

Do y'all believe it affects the players really that much and have y'all heard when both teams will arrive in london?",53,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dffe2z/london_games/,3349.075320068995,r/fantasyfootball
Reddit Adjusted Fantasy Football Trade Values Week 6,"Welcome back to another week of fantasy football. We saw some crazy explosions in scoring last week, but let us try not to overreact. We saw some stud wide receivers underachieve as well, do not worry they are still studs. Try not to freak out too much!

To generate trade values, I combine [Harris football](https://www.harrisfootball.com/ros-ranks) rankings with [Fantasypro](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/ros-overall.php?filters=8a133a36fe) rankings and apply an algorithm I wrote based on historical values and trends. Next, I average these values with [CBS](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-week-6-trade-values-chart-rest-of-season-rankings/) and 4for4 values (if applicable) to normalize across the industry. Lastly, I apply a PPR correction factor and create the 0.5 PPR values as well. I generated my functions by using historical data, Reddit Trade threads, and the Yahoo trade market. My goal was to look for crossover points in 1 for 1 player positional trades to generate tiers and normalize across positions. My goal is to incorporate as many sources and experts as possible to eliminate or minimize bias.

As I discussed previously, I believe the experts have a lot of bias towards the top, bottom, and between the positions. I check the comments on the expert's articles every week and see the disapproval and outright anger at some of the rankings. My goal was to try and adjust the values using crowd-sourced data (Reddit+Yahoo) to create better trade values.

*Significant Updates:*

Updated PPR multiplier values

*Key Assumption:*

12 team: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 TE/WR/RB.

*FAQ:*

“Where are the standard or PPR values? “

Answer: Change the tab or the spreadsheet, or scroll down on the image.

“What is the QB value in 2-QB leagues? “

Answer: Double the QB values and it will be close

“What does 10-team league do to values?”

Answer: Smaller league means higher tiered players are worth more. Tiers 1-3 go up and tiers 6-7 have very little value.

“What about 3 WR leagues?”

Answer: WRs value increases due to slight drop in scarcity

“Where are the defenses?

Answer: Defenses don’t matter to the experts. Patriots and Bears have value. Hard to quantify

“Why is X player so low?”

Answer: Because you own them and god hates you

“How do I use this chart?”

Answer: Add player values on each side of the trade and compare for fairness. That simple.

""Did you mean to spell X wrong?""

Answer: No, spelling is hard. I do science and stuff

“What about Dynasty, bro?

Answer: Dynasty is a completely different beast. Maybe next year homie

“What about keeper and draft picks?”

Answer: Great Question. I do not know. Keepers change the trade game. I do not factor them in. Draft picks are tough to quantify as well. I think you can estimate a value by averaging the values of the 12 players on the chart corresponding to the round. (Example average players 1-12 to get a first round pick). Then, you would need to weight the value to include rest of season usage and uncertainty in the draft pick next year. So many 50% of the average is what I am guessing. All this is theory.

TL:DR.

When is it the correct time to drop a player with name value?,"Chilling in a league where it feels like I'm playing against A.I. cause no one does trades (or I guess I make shit offers dunno I'll keep trying).

Issue is when it comes to placing waiver pickups you come to this weird point where someone with name value/was drafted that's performing not well is the technically best choice to cut from the team but don't because odds are is he'll be instantly picked up.

So, I'm curious as to what you guys do? Just deal with it and stash in order to prevent your opponent from having them? Or cut ties by not getting so attached to the player to the point it could actually hinder your fantasy team?",28,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfeu6g/when_is_it_the_correct_time_to_drop_a_player_with/,3412.2253200968107,r/fantasyfootball

Juszczyk is out but SF's schedule is nothing to fear,"Undoubtedly Juszczyk is a big part of the running game for San Francisco. While his 4-6 week certainly hurts the run game, here's why it came at a time that shouldn't affect them too much:


* SF is averaging the league high 200.0 rushing yards per game

* Breida is averaging 6.5 YPA which is the highest in the NFL, Coleman is averaging 5.5 YPA

* 5 of their next 7 opponents are within the bottom 10 defenses in rushing yards allowed per game (2 of those meetings are against ARZ)

* Their week 13 opponent is the Ravens (10th against the run) but they should have Juszczyk back.......and maybe even Joe Staley


The biggest hurdle is predicting who gets the majority of the work between Breida and Coleman but both could be serviceable. Either way they're in for what should be a cakewalk of a schedule. If they struggle a bit against the Rams they could be buy low-ish candidates",40,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfc5cy/juszczyk_is_out_but_sfs_schedule_is_nothing_to/,3720.6586535016695,r/fantasyfootball

WRs Due for Potential Improvement | Trade Candidates,"Below is a list of WR's who are currently TOP 50 in both air yards as well as target shares AND have 1 TD or less so far this season. The thought process is that since air yards is a calculation of the total receiving yards on both complete as well as incomplete passes, and target share is an indication of how often a player is thrown to, that players in the TOP 50 of each category who have yet to score 2 touchdowns might be due to improve moving forward. However, considering there are 3 Dolphins players on this list there may be some flaws in the theory. Regardless, I included each players position rank through 5 weeks this season to help you all get a sense of how your fellow owners might be valuing each player as of right now if you do consider making a move for any of them.

The Ultimate D/ST Streaming Cheat Sheet for the ROS,"Below is a table consisting of the TOP 8 teams in the NFL based on fantasy points allowed to opposing D/STs (*Based on Fantasy Pros Matchup Calendar)* and their schedules for the rest of the season. Essentially, eight of the worst offenses in the NFL -- in terms of how many points fantasy D/ST's score against them -- are listed across the top row. Below each team is their ROS schedule with TOP 12 fantasy D/ST's (*Based on Fantasy Pros standard league stats*) denoted by a superscript number that corresponds with their season rank. This reference is intended to let owners in deep leagues, as well as owners with bench spots to spare, find streaming D/ST's to stash before anyone else. Personally, I am considering picking up the 49ers D/ST this week despite a tough match-up with the Rams, and stashing them until next week when they play the lowly Washington Redskins. Anyway, comment with any sneaky matchups that are looking tasty in the future as well as any suggestions for if I ever do something similar to this in the future! :)

Week 6 #FF Waiver Wire Pickups,"In this article, we're going to talk about players who are owned in 50% or less of Yahoo leagues who should be owned. We have 3 players for each position that we think should be owned for Week 6 and beyond. 

QB
1. Gardner Minshew II (24% owned) - It's time to take this man seriously. Minshew is the #11 ranked fantasy QB for the season, and he isn't slowing down. He's a great deep league QB1 and solid streamer in plus matchups. 

2. Kirk Cousins (41% owned) - Cousins is a more-than-serviceable QB when facing subpar defenses. If he was dropped, I'd add him and consider starting him against inferior defenses. 



*DEEP LEAGUE*

3. Sam Darnold (13% owned) - It sounds like Darnold will make his return this Sunday, and I really liked him coming into his sophomore season. He is getting playmaking TE Chris Herndon back this week to go along with Robby Anderson, Jamison Crowder, and Le'Veon Bell. He'll put up low-end QB1/high-end QB2 numbers the rest of the way. 

RB
1. Adrian Peterson (47% owned) - Any RB starting for an NFL team should be owned in all leagues no matter how bad the team is. Peterson is a low-end flex play against solid teams and RB2 against inferior teams (Note: he faces the Dolphins this Sunday). 

2. Rex Burkhead (28% owned) - Even though he's been dealing with an injury as of late, he is expected back this week. Any piece of this Patriots offense I can have on my team and start in plus matchups is something I want on my team. 

*DEEP LEAGUE*

3. Chase Edmonds (3% owned) - Chase is the direct handcuff to David Johnson. The past few weeks, Johnson has been playing through a myriad of injuries. Just in case one of those injuries turns out to be more serious and Johnson misses any time, Edmonds will turn into a volume-based RB2.



WR
1. Jamison Crowder (44% owned) - Back in Week 1, Darnold targeted Crowder 17 times! Darnold is coming back, so I expect Crowder to see 7-8 targets per game. 

2. Mohamed Sanu (42% owned) - Despite not being flashy and a true WR1 or WR2, Sanu has been the model of consistency. Through the first 5 weeks, Sanu has averaged 7+ targets per game. Pick him up for his solid floor.



*DEEP LEAGUE*

3. Dante Pettis (20% owned) - Pettis was everyone's favorite sleeper heading into the season. He suffered an injury late in the preseason, and it clearly slowed him down. He has been deemed fully healthy, and I'm willing to take a shot on him becoming Garoppolo's favorite target. 

TE

1. Chris Herndon (29% owned) - Herndon is a PLAYMAKER. He's coming back from suspension this week at the same time Darnold is coming back from his illness. This is a recipe for success! I'm adding him everywhere I can. 

2. Gerald Everett (9% owned) - With Higbee being slowly phased out, Everett has been a key part of this high-octane offense. Any contributing piece of this Rams offense is worth your attention. Over the past two weeks, he's received 8+ targets. Last week he went off to the tune of 7 receptions for 136 yards. Goff likes him which means you should, too!



*DEEP LEAGUE*

3. Dawson Knox (16% owned) - Knox is a promising rookie who is developing a nice rapport with Josh Allen. The Bills have a bye this week, so you wouldn't be able to start him until Week 7, but I would add him in deep leagues and see if that chemistry keeps getting stronger. 

DEF & K Streamers & Pickups for Week 6

DEF

1. Carolina (41% owned) at Buccaneers 
2. Denver (29% owned) vs Titans

*DEEP LEAGUE*

3. Washington (4% owned) at Dolphins

K
1. Josh Lambo (39% owned) vs Saints
2. Mike Nugent (26% owned) vs Giants
3. Matt Bryant (24% owned) at Cardinals

Is Chris Thompson still worth a season long bench stash still?,"So with the news of Jay Gruden's departure, that leaves Chris Thompson in a weird situation. He thrived in Gruden's system, always being used as a third down back and great in short pass scenarios. But that was with Gruden. His last 5 games have all been pretty quiet for yardage, but he thrives in PPR because of his targets and receptions

Week 1 (@PHI) - 3 Att for 10 yds; 10 targets for 7 rec & 68 yds: 14.8 FP

Week 2 (DAL) - 2 Att for 3 yds; 8 targets for 5 rec & 48 yds: 10.10 FP

Week 3 (CHI) - 7 att for 29 yds; 5 targets for 4 rec & 79 yds: 14.8 FP

Week 4 (@NYG) - 4 att for 4 yds; 5 targets for 4 rec & 56 yds: 10 fp

Week 5 (NE) - 4 att for 21 yds; 7 targets for 5 rec & 17 yds: 8.8 FP

So with the whole QB situation in Washington that resulted in Colt McCoy starting and the firing of Jay Gruden, will Chris Thompson still have the amount of volume moving forward. Will their game script change so much and utilize AP so much more that the target volume for Chris Thompson begins to slow down? Basically is Chris Thompson really worth my bench stash or is he just the bye week fill in?",28,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfa39m/is_chris_thompson_still_worth_a_season_long_bench/,3905.9419871846835,r/fantasyfootball

Something has to be going on behind the scenes with AJ Green,"It's very strange that he is being ruled out a week before the game. They don't even leave open the possibility of him practicing. He already said that he is not resigning with Cincy so I cant see a scenario with him not getting traded. Cincy doesnt even want to win this year so they may as well get anything they can in return. So what are people doing with AJG? Buying low, selling to a top team because they can afford the wait? I think potential landing spots include NE, NO, BUF, and PHI. All except maybe BUF could boost his value. Who am I missing?",94,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df9s76/something_has_to_be_going_on_behind_the_scenes/,3930.8753205657003,r/fantasyfootball
Average Expert FAAB - Week 6 Waiver Wire (Wasteland Edition),"**Google Sheets:** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9dJMCoH6TxFXG5dwBpsWoX1DSY0hbeJZtcbUD67AfM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9dJMCoH6TxFXG5dwBpsWoX1DSY0hbeJZtcbUD67AfM/edit?usp=sharing)

Hi Folks,

I've compiled FAAB bid recommendations from 10+ sites into a single spreadsheet that shows the *average bid*, *max bid*, and *number of mentions*.

Note: This process is useful for more than just FAAB leagues. One problem with non-FAAB waiver wire articles is that it's hard to get a sense of which players to prioritize. By compiling FAAB recommendations from a number of different articles, you can see how players are valued relative to each other.

**Relevant Info**

* The bid recommendation numbers are for % of total FAAB.
* Assumes a 1QB league.
* Players mentioned only once are hidden
* To view sources, unhide Columns H-U
* For sites that give a range, I recorded the average

Good luck this week boys!

David Johnson Outlook,"There hasn't been much information about his potential back issue but they have a juicy matchup against Atlanta this week.


Are DJ owners spending a #1 claim on Edmonds or sizable FAAB to protect themselves? Even if you don't own DJ, are you willing to pay up on waivers with uncertain information?

Week 6 Waiver Report - DFA,"#**Week 6 Waiver Report**


It’s a down week for the waiver wire, but that shouldn't stop owners from making savvy moves for future weeks at a discount price - the down week provides a solid opportunity to plan for future bye weeks, or to scoop a disappointing sleeper/handcuff as others are forced to drop players due to their situation/current bye weeks. 


Let’s start with the handcuffs, some of these players may have found their way onto the wire or can be obtained for little to no cost.  


#**RB Alexander Mattison - Minnesota Vikings**


Possibly the most valuable handcuff in fantasy, Mattison would have RB1 upside if thrust into a featured role. He needs to be stashed in all leagues. 



#**RB Latavius Murray - New Orleans Saints**


Murray has found his way onto most waiver wires but should still be stashed in 10+ team leagues. He offers standalone RB2/3 upside with the return of Drew Brees and is a must roster for Alvin Kamara owners. 


#**RB Malcolm Brown - Los Angeles Rams**


Since Todd Gurley has been utilized more the last two weeks, Brown has seen his snaps bottom out, only playing 3 in Week 5. It’s unclear if Gurley is actually turning a corner health wise, or if McVay is planning to ride him until the wheels fall off. Either way, Brown has a clear role if Gurley’s health refuses to cooperate and it seems likely given the chronic arthritis in his surgically repaired knee. Interestingly, rookie Darrell Henderson has barely seen the field this year after being touted as a sleeper by many. 


#**RB Chase Edmonds - Arizona Cardinals**


Edmonds is shaping up to be the No. 1 add this week as it becomes clear that David Johnson (back) is in real danger of missing time. You’ll likely need to unload the top waiver priority or a significant amount of FAAB for him (<15%). For DJ owners he’s a must have, non-DJ owners can consider him a short bye week fill in or trade bait. Upgrade for PPR. 


#**RB Tony Pollard - Dallas Cowboys**


Hopefully Zeke owners weren’t forced to pay a pretty penny to obtain Pollard before the season. Now is the time to claim your handcuff at an extremely discounted price via trade or for free off the wire.


#**RB Giovani Bernard - Cincinnati Bengals**


Gio always seems to find a way to be relevant in fantasy for at least a couple weeks. Given that Cincinnati is going nowhere this season and that Mixon has already missed time, Gio should be rostered in 12+ team leagues. Mixon owners should especially take notice and grab their handcuff while he’s cheap. 


This relatively unexciting waiver time is also an opportunity for stashing future contributors. Here’s a few that could be valuable later in the season that are either on the wire now, or will be dropped in the waiver cycle by impatient owners.


#**QB - Gardner Minshew - Jacksonville Jaguars**


Minshew from a fantasy standpoint has been a solid contributor, but he hasn’t broken onto fantasy rosters with a statement week yet. His value to this point has been derived from his consistency - he’s averaging 17.8 FPPG and has yet to score less than 16 fantasy points since taking over as the starter. The “Jock Strap King” is the #11 QB through 5 weeks and could climb in a hurry with one big week. He’s worth rostering if you have the space to see how the story ends. 


#**RB - Adrian Peterson - Washington Redskins**


Really, this recommendation is due to the lack of depth at running back rather than AP’s talent. Interim coach Bill Callahan has mentioned that he wants to run the ball more and the hope is that AP sees an increase in volume. He should be added, but don’t expect him to be more than a bye week fill in or middling flex option. 


#**WR - Diontae Johnson - Pittsburgh Steelers**


The Steelers offense is all sorts of banged up right now, Mason Rudolph is in the concussion protocol after taking a scary hit last week and James Washington suffered a shoulder injury that will potentially keep him out a couple weeks. Additionally, pass-catching back Jaylen Samuels is going to miss a month after undergoing a knee scope. Essentially, it’s a long winded way of saying someone has to catch the ball for 3rd string quarterback Devlin Hodges. Johnson had a down week last week (meaning he didn’t catch a long touchdown) but the targets are there - he received the most on the team with 8. 


#**WR - Auden Tate - Cincinnati Bengals**


He was most likely scooped up last week but if he’s still on your wire he’s worth taking a chance on until A.J. Green returns. His fantasy line last week was salvaged by a touchdown, but Cincinnati will be forced to throw plenty all season and the volume should be there while Green and Ross are out. 


#**WR - Darius Slayton - New York Giants**


Another popular add this week, Slayton offers some upside with Sterling Shepard expected to be out several weeks with a second concussion in less than a month. While the volume could be there for Slayton, a glaring issue is the Giants schedule in the immediate future - they face the Patriots, Cardinals and Lions. He may be worth owning for the Cardinals game alone, but the other two games he will most likely be a recommended sit against very good secondaries. Plan accordingly. 


#**WR - Preston Williams & Devante Parker - Miami Dolphins**


Yes, Miami historically sucks and yeah, you probably won’t ever start either of these players. However, you could do much worse at the end of your roster. Both players are producing, albeit minimally, but can be used in a pinch. The edge goes to Preston Williams - he’s quietly averaging 10.3 FPPG in PPR. Devante Parker is averaging 9 FPPG and that’s with a goose egg against NE in Week 2. It’s clear that Miami is garbage, but they could produce some garbage time kings as the schedule softens. Week 6’s poop fest against the Redskins is a good place to start. 


#**WR - Jamison Crowder - New York Jets**


Jamison Crowder caught more passes in one game with Sam Darnold than three without. The Jets quarterback is returning this week from Mono and Crowder needs to be rostered across the board. He could quickly make his way back into the WR2 ranks with a healthy Darnold, upgrade in PPR. 


#**TE - Gerald Everett - Los Angeles Rams**


Everett now has back-to-back solid weeks under his belt and is a must add after going for 136 yards against the Seahawks. His target share the last two weeks would seem to indicate that he may be a consistent contributor moving forward, however, the increased volume may be due to fellow tight end Tyler Higbee missing Week 4, and wideout Brandin Cooks leaving Week 5 with a concussion. Either way, Everett needs to be rostered to see if the breakout continues. 


#**TE - Chris Herndon - New York Jets**


With the outlook of the Jets offense improving with the return of their quarterback, Herndon deserves to be stashed and quite possibly started this week after returning from suspension. At 6-foot-4, the Miami product makes a great red zone target and should be heavily involved in an offense lacking weapons.

"Official: [Tuesday Waiver Wire] - Tue Evening, 10/08/2019","#Tuesday Waiver Wire Thread  

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it’s worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.   


--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you'd like to discuss something outside of this theme, please try checking the [latest Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day) for a thread that might be more suitable for you. If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

49ers + Saints is a good defensive combo for weeks 7-11,"Pretty good defensive combo with a decently high floor that might still be available in your league. Here is a breakdown of their combined schedule in the coming weeks

* 9ers vs Car
* **Saints vs Ari**

Mike Evans ROS,"First two weeks he was riddled by a stomach bug. Week 3 was amazing. Week 4 was saved by the long touchdown, and week 5 was a goose egg.
How are we feeling about him ROS? Will opposing defenses shift their focus towards Godwin as the season progress? Will Winston be able to look downfield more? 
I’m still starting him every week, just curious what others are thinking? 
Are you trading him? If so what kinda deal are you looking to package up together?",98,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df7qui/mike_evans_ros/,4082.491987601916,r/fantasyfootball
Let's Stream Defenses: Week 6 (2019),"Hello! Week 6 is here and we're all starting to get pretty nervous about being 1-4. (Thanks for that, Mike Evans) With Sam Darnold returning this week, we were set to lose the best matchup for opposing defenses, but the football gods decide we need another undrafted 3rd-string quarterback starting in the league. We all saw Mason Rudolph get annihilated last week, and as much as that sucks, that means... \*googles Steelers backup QB\* Devlin Hodges will probably start next week. This is great news for the Chargers, because I don't expect that offense to be functional. As for the Jets, it's not like upgrading to Darnold makes them a wagon all of the sudden. He's still prone to turnovers, and Vegas has hardly budged on their line.

And yes, I do think Washington defense is a good play this week. They haven't been great, but Miami has been worse - they're four games in and haven't topped 10 points! The quality of the offense is way more predictive of fantasy D/ST scoring than the quality of the defense, so I'm happy to bet against Miami, even with Washington.

Here are all the teams I rank as starters.

Will Devonta finally become a Free Man?,"So Devonta hasnt been his usual self this season but hes coming off a freak injury and there are some positive signs.  Ito smith is a poop JAG they have used just to not overwork Free. He faced some good defenses early and put up some sub par performances but his point total has gone up every week. Hes averaging 12 carries and 4.5 catches a game and i only expect those numbers to go up considering he faced some tough defenses and bad game scripts(@Min,vsPHI,@Ind,vsTen,@Hou). As we all know His SPARQ score and football IQ is off the charts. How do you guys expect him to perform ROS? is he a solid rb2/ lowend rb1 or more of a fringe boom or bust high end flex play/rb3? what is his trade value? Atlanta has looked like skr8 buns but i dont expect them to be this bad all season",30,0.39,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df7onk/will_devonta_finally_become_a_free_man/,4086.7586542844774,r/fantasyfootball
Any Predictions for Marshon Lattimore vs. WR1's?," I'm trying to pay more attention this year to top end corners that make it worth sitting your stud WR's. For instance, this week I'm considering sitting newly minted must start DJ Chark since he's against Lattimore. Mostly this is the discussion I wish happened last week so I could have sat Evans.

Forgive me if some of these stats are wrong, they're kind of cobbled together from a variety of places and I can't quite tell how to get stats JUST for when he was covering someone.

Week 1 (vs. Texans): Hopkins/Fueller 5-47-1  
Week 2 (at Rams): Cooks/Woods 5-142-1  
Week 3 (at Seahawks): Lockett/Metcalf 10-152-0  
Week 4 (vs. Cowboys): Cooper, 5-48-0  
Week 5 (vs. Buccaneers): Evans, 0-0-0

I know NFL analysts love to say Lattimore shows up for big time matchups (Cooper, Evans) but he can get bored with others. Not sure how much I want to believe in a motivation based narrative, but the difference between what he's done in weeks 4-5 vs weeks 1-3 is pretty drastic.

Does someone with more knowledge of Lattimore of Saints defensive tendencies have any expectations for their defense moving forward? Will Lattimore shadow the top receiving option each week? Just for matchups with the top top top elite guys?

For reference:  
Week 6 - Jags (Chark)  
Week 7 - Bears (Robinson)  
Week 8 - Cardinals (Fitz?)  
Week 9 - Bye  
Week 10 - Falcons (Julio)  
Week 11 - Buccaneers (Evans, again...or maybe at this point Godwin???)  
Week 12 - Panthers  
Week 13 - Falcons (Julio)  
Week 14 - 49ers

Reddit Consensus Positional Rankings [Week 6] (Voting Post),"For those that have never seen these posts before, its a pretty simple concept.  
**1.** Each week I'll create a post on Tuesday morning which will link to 4 voting polls, 1 for each of the following positions QB,RB,WR,TE.   
**2.** Each poll will consist of a list of players at that specific position (18-20 for QB & TE polls) and (40-50 for RB & WR polls).  
**3.** The poll will automatically generate a random match-up between 2 of the players from that position, and ask you simply ""Who will perform better in PPR this week?"".  
**4.** All you have to do is choose who you personally think will perform better, ie ""Score More Fantasy Points"".  
**5.** The Polls are never ending and will continue to generate random 1vs1 match-ups until you eventually exit out.   

**To Contribute toward this effort all I ask is that you spend a few minutes to open up each of the following polls and just vote on a handful of generated match-ups, helping create a more true consensus of /r/fantasyfootball**

*The idea is to gather as many users from this sub as possible all contributing toward the poll by answering a few ""match-ups"" for each positional poll to gain a consensus rankings that will be posted each Thursday. The ranks allow people that are constantly asking ""start/sit"" questions between two players at the same position to garner the consensus opinion (in ranking form) of the entire sub, vs having maybe 1 to 2 people if that answer their roster decision on the daily index posts. I also will have them compared to the Fantasy Pros Experts' Consensus Ranks when I post the results on Thursdays allowing for the sub to see where we might be high or low in comparison on certain players.*",0,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df6y4p/reddit_consensus_positional_rankings_week_6/,4137.408654487133,r/fantasyfootball

[LINK TO GOOGLE PDF OF ANALYSIS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KCm_osoKr9G2goJOvkLmBnwOx3CDbH8/view?usp=sharing)

[LINK TO GOOGLE SHEET OF RAW DATA FROM PRO-FOOTBALL-REFERENCE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E_JPKcGGZViYbgwKTxrr1Gz2ih7TpvDWb0d97pnHk-E/edit?usp=sharing)

Week 5 is in the books!  Thank you to the kind stranger who gilded my last post, that was a first for me.   
 I also want to thank everyone who shares their feedback and appreciation in the comments. You guys are awesome and you all help shape this analysis.  I will of course use discretion in regards to which changes to implement but I am always open to new ideas and viewpoints.

This week I've also include a Google Sheet of the raw data which is just the fantasy points for all players through the first 5 weeks in case you want to get weird with it on your own but don't like the data extraction part.

&#x200B;

**Original Post for Reference:**

So what is this thing? I basically wanted to solve the mystery of “season average fantasy points per game”. With injuries and byes, you can never get a good look at the best fantasy players by total points, so I’m sure we all go and look at season average fantasy points per game to see who the best free agents are or to help decide sit/starts.

However I’m sure you’ve realized, there is an inherent problem when you do this. I always mentally called it “Desean Jackson Syndrome”. You’ve got two players you are comparing and they both are averaging 10 points a game through the first 3 weeks. However one of the guys scored 9, 10, & 11 and the other guy scored 1, 25, & 4 (Desean Jackson). The only way to know that this occurred is to click on each guy and look at the game logs, which is very annoying and time consuming.

Using pro-football-reference.com I was able to query the results of each player for each week and compile it all into one workbook. To make things simple and to match most of my leagues, I brought in fantasy points scored each week in a half-point PPR format. I then compared the points scored each week to the average in order to determine statistical dispersion, which basically is how far away do players stray from their average.

What you will find in the shared Google Drive PDF is the ability to determine the difference between consistent players or those that are boom-or-bust. You always hear, “that guy is reliable, he has a high floor” or “you can’t trust him, he’s boom-or-bust”, well now you can visually see those characteristics in the data.

Few things to keep in mind when you look at this:

* Fantasy points are shown with half-point PPR
* Anyone who hasn’t played in at least 50% of the weeks over any given period are filtered out
* Anyone who is averaging <5 fantasy points are filtered out
* This is simply a guide to help you analyze past performance of players and it does not provide game context or predict future performance

I hope you guys enjoy and thanks for all the advice over the years!",6,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df6nfn/marzs_boomorbust_analysis_2019_week_5/,4157.525321165721,r/fantasyfootball

Hey Everybody!

If you are confused about what this is then jump down to **Introduction for Newbies and FAQ at the end.**

# I AM GETTING MARRIED THIS WEEK!

I just wanted to get that out of the way to warn everyone that uses this tool that **I will be completely unavailable from Oct. 10th - Oct. 21st, If something breaks you will just have to deal with it.** Against my own better judgement, I wanted to release one more update before I went on hiatus.

If you want to review previous changes that I have made for this tool. [**Look here**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Prokupine/comments/d3uqfb/borischen_guide_change_log/)

# Features Added in v2.3.0

* [Automatic Matchup Importing](https://i.imgur.com/sfyFJor.png)
   * I offer a matchup tab where you can compare your roster with your opponents, I used to require you to paste in your opponents team, but now I scrape your league and automatically import the roster of the team you are facing this week! Currently it works for Yahoo, NFL, and Sleeper (you just need to type in the week #). I might do ESPN, and Fleaflicker down the road.
* Yahoo Custom League Support
   * If you were in a Yahoo league that had [custom scoring (40yd TDs, Pick Six, etc.)](https://i.imgur.com/yyBlooK.png) then I couldn't import your free agency players because their names were shortened (J. Gordon instead of Josh Gordon) Now I am actually pulling in the player IDs and comparing that to a table. Shout out to /u/flipperbw for the help in getting the IDs for every player. This was a huge undertaking.
* Yahoo defenses are 100% accurate now.
   * Due to the fix put in place above, a positive outcome is I can distinguish New York Jets vs New York Giants whereas before, Yahoo would only let me pull in ""New York"" (also Los Angeles). This was a challenge because if I looked for Los Angeles in the tiers I might not pull in the correct one.
* [Timestamp for when BorisChen Tiers are updated](https://i.imgur.com/k5KczxX.png)
   * Boris has been a tad hit or miss this year on when Tiers get updated on [BorisChen.co](https://www.borischen.co/). So on the Welcome page, I will display a timestamp on when the tiers have been updated! I added this in the last update, but now its more reliable. If Boris updates the tiers, then my timestamp will change within 30 minutes or so.

# Bug Fixes in v2.3.0

* Fleaflicker's matchup section wasn't importing correctly for the opponents roster.
* Some cells auto adjusted randomly on the matchup tab, they are fixed now.

# 

# Introduction for Newbies

Basically, I made an excel sheet 2 years ago. It has now evolved into a Google Sheet that shows you what tiers your players are in from [BorisChen.co](http://www.borischen.co/). This sheet supports ESPN, NFL, Yahoo, Fleaflicker, Sleeper, and MFL platforms by automatically importing your team(s)\*

**\*a large caveat is that the leagues need to be ""Viewable to the Public""** (except Sleeper or MFL)**.** This is a league setting that is turned off by default. If you are the commissioner, then change it. If you aren't the commissioner then share this post with them and convince them to change the setting.

All you need to do is:

1. Click [this link](http://bit.ly/31Zhlhd)
2. Sign in with a Google associated account
3. Make a copy
4. Insert your team link(s)
5. If you are in 2 leagues with the same platform then simply right-click that tab and duplicate that tab

**P.S. I advise you delete the tab for leagues you don't use. This will help performance.**

# FAQ​

**Q:** How often does it refresh?

**A:** Let me answer that generic question with 3 answers.

1. My formulas pull the tiers from [BorisChen.co](http://www.borischen.co/) every hour, which is overkill because....
2. [BorisChen.co](http://www.borischen.co/) updates his tiers once a day (8am PST) on Tuesday - Sunday. The rankings get more accurate as you get closer to Sunday
3. To refresh *your league*, just toggle the Refresh ""Button"" (it's a checkbox)

**Q:** These rankings are way off!

**A:** 99% of the time that means the tiers are off on BorisChen.co . If you ever think ""my ranks"" are wrong, then go to the source and double check. The ranks are more wild at the beginning of the week.

**Q:** I put my team link into the sheet, but it's not importing my team.

**A:** That probably means that your league is not ""Viewable to the Public"" which it needs to be. Ask the commish to change the setting.

**Q:** Do I need to redownload this next week?

**A: No!** the sheet will update every time new tiers are posted. The only time you will need to ""redownload"" (Make a new copy), is if I the version is out of date

**Q:** Why aren't certain players ranked in Flex tiers?

**A:** [/u/Prayes](https://www.reddit.com/u/Prayes) doesn't include ""obvious"" starts in the Flex tier since usually you don't need to see if it's a good idea to start Alvin Kamario.

**Q:** Can you do CBS?

**A:** CBS can't be accessed publicly and I can't reliably pass access tokens. So I don't think so

**Q:** It used to import my team, but now it doesn't!

**A:** Check or uncheck the refresh ""Button""

**Q:** How can I donate?

**A:** No one has asked this but...... [Venmo](https://venmo.com/Josh-Prokupek) or [Paypal](http://paypal.me/joshprokupek) **:)**

**Q:** Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to refresh my roster.

**A:** ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

**Q:** Can you do IDP/Superflex?

**A:** No

**Q:** How can I never miss an update?

**A:** Subscribe to my email list with this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciFEL4qiTVuc6EWMgRu911wqADNfH2Agy6k2DwtGdhfIw4nw/viewform?usp=sf_link). 450+ subscribers and counting!

Djax value,"Reading rumblings that he’ll likely return in the Dallas game.

Ive been wondering how much of his week 1 explosion was due to him/wentz or more due to WAS being poo. His targets and wentz’s accuracy have led me to believe he’ll be more boom with a higher floor than previously but I could just be falling for the same tricks idk.

Hayden Hurst- under the radar 1 week TE streamer,"Mark Andrews’ persistent foot problems mixed with his injury scare last week caused me to look into his replacement.

In my PPR league I found out that Hayden Hurst has been decent under the radar. Through 5 weeks he’s yet to have a game without a catch or less than 3 pts (which can’t be said for guys like OJ Howard). He’s posted a stat line of 12 rec/15 tgts/127 yds/1 TD. He comes in at TE # 24 in that type of league. 

It’s a stretch but if you need a TE for 1 week he could fill the role plus if you happen to have him and Andrews goes down you have a TE lottery ticket.",23,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df4zgv/hayden_hurst_under_the_radar_1_week_te_streamer/,4271.791988066832,r/fantasyfootball

5 Weeks down. 11 Weeks to go. Go get these guys to lead you to the playoffs and beyond.,"So every league is different. Some are 8 teams, 10 teams, 12+. Some play standard, some play HPPR some play Full PPR. Some do Flex or SuperFlex or 2QBs. Whatever you play use this post at your discretion. 

Most likely there isn't going to be a Top 5 RB or QB or WR or TE on the waivers. No one is really shopping [or they shouldn't] Mahomes or CMC or Michael Thomas.

But I believe these WR, RB, QBs, DEF and TE could be your missing piece. Whether it's for bye weeks or just that last guy to solidify your lineup.

So some may be on waivers and some you may be able to trade for but I believe these 8 Players can pay dividends and get you on track for the playoffs.

1. QB - Sam Darnold. Now if you waited for a QB in the draft like a lot of us do you might have been stuck with Roethlisberger, maybe Rivers, Winston or myself who chose Dak in the 15th rd. Darnold's Week 9-14 [MIA NYG WSH OAK CIN MIA) is one of the best schedules out there. He will have a full range of weapons between Bell, Anderson, Crowder and Herndon [both you will see later] Most likely is on waivers since he has been dealing with Mono. He's back week 6.

2. WR - Terry McLaurin. He was Keenum's security blanket. Rookie with TDs in 1st 3 games. Once Haskins is named starter Scary Terry could be huge. IMO Possible Top 20-25 WR ROS. Go trade for him if you can

3. WR - DJ Chark Jr. Jags WR1. Gardner's best friend. He is showing he could be matchup proof. 5 TDs on year. 55 Yards AND  a TD in 4 out of 5 games this year. I just traded for him. You should too.

4. WR - Jamison Crowder. This might be a PPR special. Only 43% Owned in Yahoo leagues. With Darnold back Crowder should flourish. 17 Targets 14 Rec Week 1 with Sam. Go out. That could be your WR3 ROS

5. RB - Tevin Coleman. He's in a RBBC with Matt Brieda. Coleman like in ATL is the 1B to the 1A. I
He can be serviceable as RB2 for Bye weeks or even as a Flex. First game back since Week 1 dropped 97 and a TD.

6. RB: Joe Mixon. His stock has never been lower. Almost feel like he can turn it around. He has too. He's too good. Talk to the Mixon owner, he can be had. Week 14 vs Cleveland. Championship vs Miami in Week 16

7. TE - Chris Herndon. Last year ended as TE15 in STD. He's back from suspension. Was critical to Sam's development. Will be a key RZ target. Go get him if you didn't while he was suspended. His Bye Week is over so you'll have him for every game ROS.

8. DEF - NYJ. Yes the 4th Jet on this list, but this might be one of the most crucial. Week 9-14 [MIA NYG WSH OAK CIN MIA) You're not going to get a better 6 week period from any team. If you could pair them up with a solid def like Buff or NE (I am) you could have a significant advantage going to the post season. 6% Owned on Yahoo.",134,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df4tmz/5_weeks_down_11_weeks_to_go_go_get_these_guys_to/,4283.375321431955,r/fantasyfootball

If you're worried about Keenan Allen don't be. We've yet to see Sleeves Keenan Allen.,"Keenan Allen has put together two subpar games after starting the year off with a bang. After his big week 3 Coach Lynn and Phillip Rivers stated that they couldn't rely so much on getting KA the ball and they need to spread it out more. Since then KA has gotten 11 targets in two games after 42 targets in the first 3. But should this worry you as a first year KA owner? Those who've had him say other wise. Keenan Allen used to be known for wearing baggy sleeves every week in his earlier years. Now he results to wearing them when it starts getting cold outside. And when he does he takes his game to another level. Lets take a look 

**2017**

*September & October*

73 targets, 40 catches, 543 yards, 1 TD 

*November & December*

86 targets, 62 catches, 845 yards, 5 TDs 

**2018** 

*September & October*

56 targets, 41 catches, 506 yards, 1 TD

*November & December*

80 targets, 56 catches, 690 yards, 5 TDs 

**2019**

*September & October (so far)*

53 targets, 38 catches, 470 yards, 3 TDs 

So as you can see Keenan Allen is again doing relatively the same in Sept and Oct as he has done the past two years. So barring injury (knock on wood), when its time for him to roll down the sleeves as temperatures drop I expect Sleeves Keenan Allen to active.",153,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df3f1i/if_youre_worried_about_keenan_allen_dont_be_weve/,4386.208654932181,r/fantasyfootball
Through 5 weeks Will Dissly is the #1 TE in standard leagues,"Coming into the NFL, Dissly was pegged as a high-end blocking TE. Through 9 total career games played, including 2 games where he went down with injury, Dissly has caught 6 TDs. He has a catch rate this season of 88.5%. Clearly he has evolved as a player and is not just a blocker anymore.

Is he fast? No. Is he athletic? No. But he is a reliable target for Wilson with a great catch rate, large share of team targets, and a nose for the end zone (4 TDs this year). He'll stay on the field due to his excellent blocking skills. 

Dissly is NOT a fluke, he's just a different type of productive player than the hyper athletic Evan Engram types we're used to. Dissly is a clear TE1 ROS.

Where to find amount of snaps per offesnive scheme?,"This seems like something that should be easier to find....but here we are.  Places like PFF and elsewhere give you matchup charts for offensive players vs defensive players.  But what I can't seem to find is the amount of time an offensive runs a particular scheme.  For instance, as a hypothetical.  Let's say that Team X was really bad against receivers that only line up on the right, (like Calvin Ridley) but they are only bad when their cornerbacks have to cover two other receivers (like a slot and a left WR).  Wouldn't it make sense to need to know how often the Falcons, in this case, were running 3-wide sets, and therefore could exploit that team's defensive weakness?   IF Team X doesn't have to cover a slot receiver, such as instances when the falcons had 2 RBs in the backfield, that weakness would not exist.  This seems so fundamental to me.

Chargers just embarrassed themselves against the Broncos who have been a lowly defense this year. 

Broncos D scored 11 pts in FF. 

Steelers D has been stout since acquiring Fitzpatrick from Miami. Their pass rush has been outstanding. 

They rack up sacks and turnovers. 

So why are they not projected to be a good D this week? 

Is it just because their offense is going to have a tough time against the Chargers D? Because personally I thought Hodges looked better than Rudolph. He looked poised and capable. 

He won’t be great but I don’t think he’ll be bad enough to tank his defense’s opportunities.

"Official: [Tuesday Waiver Wire] - Tue Afternoon, 10/08/2019","#Tuesday Waiver Wire Thread  

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it’s worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.   


--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

Here is the Rotoworld Waiver Wired for Week 6 2019.,,31,0.77,https://www.rotoworld.com/article/waiver-wired/waiver-wire-week-6-2,4496.991988766194,r/fantasyfootball
"Why Watson, Nuk, and Fuller should carry on their hot streak against the Chiefs.","Anyone that read my last article about Fuller hopefully made you play him and you enjoyed all those points. Let's talk about this week 

&#x200B;

 Looking back on previous weeks, it's been said you attack the chiefs with the run. The Raven's played the Chiefs on the road and ran for 202 yards divided between Ingram, Gus, and Lamar. This was actually Gus’s highest rush performance of the year so far. Lamar also threw for 267 yards split between a lot of players. Most of these throws were long throws also. Boyle averaged 14.5 yards, Hollywood with 24.5, snead with 15.7, and Seth Roberts with 18.5. Sure these are based off of 2-4 receptions each, but still had some great yardage. Lamar this game did not throw for a single touchdown, but he did run one in.

&#x200B;

The next week the lions threw for 3 touchdowns against the chiefs. Stafford threw for 291 yards, 3 TD, with 2 to Golladay and 1 to Hockensen. What did the receivers average? Marvin Jones, 25.7 yards, Golladay 13.4, Marvin Hall 23.5. Again, these are some deep passes. I would also argue that the lions WR's are more skilled than the Ravens. Golladay and Marvin jones, two really great WR's with Jones who can get the deep ball. The lions ran the ball for 173 yards, very similar to what the Colts did. 

   
 

The next week the colts throw for 151 yards overall. Looking at the averages, the highest was 11.5 yards by Hines. Looking back now, the previous two games averages were around 15 or higher. Golladay is a little lower, but he still got 2 TD's. The colts also ran the ball for 172 yards.

   
 

Looking mostly at why the Lions succeeded so well and the Colts squeezed by, I would say it was because of the deep ball. Sure, running the ball has been great for all 3 teams. Brissett ran it in for a TD, Lamar ran it in for a TD, do I predict Watson will? Sure, there's a great chance of that. Duke and Hyde together are averaging around 100 yards a game rushing. I believe that this number will be higher, sure, but if the Texans want to win they need to focus on the deep ball. 

   
 

Now if we think back to who got the deep ball last game, WILL FULLER. Do I think he will get 3 td's again? No. But I believe he will get some big catches of 20+ yards this game. Now you may be asking, ""The Texan's just played the falcons, how do you imagine Watson throws it against the Chiefs?"" Well, the Chiefs just lost Chris Jones, their star defensive lineman. Last game Andrew Wylie, Xavier Williams, Anthony Hitchens and others went down. I believe that this will help the Texans allow time to produce their longer routes. 

   
 

I would say that the Texans are close to the gameplay of the Lions where the Chiefs are again responsible for covering two dominant players (Golladay/jones vs Nuk/fuller). 

   
 

In previous games Watson has overshot Nuk and Fuller on what would be huge gains. Last game he got the easy chance to make that connection. The Ravens and Lions have proven that you can throw the deep ball against the Chiefs. Watson just proved he can make the throw. I would bet that Hopkins and Fuller have another big game here coming off their hot streak. Watson has never played Mahomes, so this is going to be a game to watch.",63,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df1uwe/why_watson_nuk_and_fuller_should_carry_on_their/,4497.325322115421,r/fantasyfootball

Trade Value Tuesday | OBJ is One Big Joke Edition,"A couple of important notes (READ THESE BEFORE POSTING, DON'T GET THIS THREAD LOCKED):This is NOT a thread to ask about trades for your specific team. Those belong in the trade thread in the stickied index posts. If we get questions like that the mods WILL lock this post and you'll ruin this for everyone.Make sure to CTRL+F your player's name to see if they've already been mentioned to avoid duplicate posts about any single player.

True value in your league is, obviously, dependent on the other owners in your league and the general trading climate. However, I think we can come together to get a better idea of where we generally stand on players.

If you have a player you want to test the level of value on, comment in this thread as a primary comment. Don't list your league settings, just the player's name. Other people then comment with their league settings and players that they currently own that they would be willing to give up in order to acquire the player listed in the primary comment. Try to list one-for-one deals as most experienced players know that 90% of the time two-for-one deals benefits the side getting the best player.

Let's use ridiculous examples just to show what this would look like:

Primary comment:

Antonio Brown

Child comment:

Dan Bailey, 9 team, 4.7 PPR

At that point, discussion under that child can include whether it's fair, too one-sided one way or the other and why.

Additionally, child comments can be packages, so if the player in question was Antonio, the response could be:

Dan Bailey and Raiders D/ST, as long as I'm getting a RB2 in the return with Antonio.

Here is a previous thread as an example to see how these should work.

To keep the thread clean, I'm requesting primary comments onlycontain the name of the player you'd like to see the value of.

CTRL-F your player's name to see if they've been asked about already.

You should be able to click ""show all ___ comments"" instead of the top 200. You can then CTRL+F your player's name and see any mention of them. Additionally, this would allow you to upvote your guy if he's currently buried to try to get him more visible and more likely to be answered.

This is NOT a thread to ask about trades for your specific team. Those belong in the trade thread in the stickied index posts. If we get questions like that the mods WILL lock this post and you'll ruin this for everyone.

I'll try to post this every Tuesday around 10 AM CST.

do NOT put your scoring settings in the parent comment, put only the player.

Be sure to check out /u/TheRealMonty's Trade Database, created to aid in finding trade values.

Players to target for playoff preparation,"It’s about that time of the season where you might be able to get a steal from teams who are desperate for wins. With that said, who are some players that can be targeted to give you an edge come playoff time? Maybe they’re hurt, maybe their matchups are poor the next couple weeks, or maybe their matchups are strong come playoff time. Either way, who are some prime targets?",14,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df1qjc/players_to_target_for_playoff_preparation/,4506.208655500412,r/fantasyfootball
Guys who streamed Dalton last week should strongly consider hanging onto him for his BAL matchup this week.,"With the exception of week 1 against Miami and week 5 against the Steelers where Mason Rudolph almost died and they had to bring in a 3rd string QB, the Ravens have allowed over 340 passing yards each game.

* Week 2 - ARI - 349
* Week 3 - @KC - 374
* Week 4 - CLE - 342

To me, that seems pretty juicy. 

Let's face it, if you had to stream Dalton, either your QB1 is Stafford against the Packers (who are 7th lowest in ff points allowed to opposing QBs) or you're streaming every week. Unless you can get Minshew (who is somehow still only rostered in <20% of leagues), I think you go Dalton this week.",38,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df1olf/guys_who_streamed_dalton_last_week_should/,4510.208655516307,r/fantasyfootball

Bold prediction: Golden Tate has a monster game this week.,"Everybody is predicting that the Patriots will zero in on Golden Tate.  But the fact is, Tate is going to be used primarily as a slot WR.  Gilmore never covers slot WRs.  His job will be to cover Darius Slayton.  So basically Tate is going to be the only one on that offense getting open.  And when you factor in how easily Patriots will score...there is a chance this will be 30 point game by half and Tate sees some easy looks in the 4th.",65,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df1eli/bold_prediction_golden_tate_has_a_monster_game/,4529.991988913218,r/fantasyfootball
Friendly Reminder: Chris Herndon is now Eligible to Play (TE for NYJ),"Next game he becomes eligible for the first time this season, coming off of a 4-game suspension plus the NYJ bye week. He finished last season as the TE15 on the year. But with all of the TE duds & and injuries this year, he is worthy of a pickup - perhaps even a waiver claim. Even if you already have a sound TE1, he will likely still have trade value in the coming weeks, as there are plenty of bye weeks on the way and NYJ have already had theirs.

I just received a notification saying Darnold is cleared to play this week, making it an even more viable pick up.",88,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df1d03/friendly_reminder_chris_herndon_is_now_eligible/,4533.158655599753,r/fantasyfootball

D.J. Chark vs the Saints,"So obviously D.J. Chark has been a stud thus far minus a 6 point week 4 in 0.5 PPR leagues due to a TD that got called back because of a penalty. After last week against a good Carolina defense we saw that he isn’t TD dependent with 8 receptions for 164 yards. That being said, is anyone concerned with the Jags offense this week vs the Saints? It seems that Lattimore is starting to get back to his lockdown ways. Would he even cover Chark or would he take on Dede? Any Saints fans here with possible insight?

Chark is likely going to stay at my WR2 for the rest of the year, but just for discussions sake, anybody concerned about this weeks matchup?",135,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df193z/dj_chark_vs_the_saints/,4541.10865565141,r/fantasyfootball

"For sale: Deandre Hopkins, never WR1","Just at the start of Week 6 now and it looks like Hopkins will once again be the top recommended name for Buy Low going forward. However, that entire argument seems to rest on past performance, and I believe there is a realistic case to be made that what we are seeing now is the new normal -- provided there are no significant injuries across the other skill players. 

&#x200B;

First to look at are the Red Zone targets, there are 2 total on the year and both were in week one. Since then we've seen Will Fuller, Duke Johnson, Carlos Hyde, Darren Fells, and Jordan Akins feature just as much and more into their playcalling in red zone. Stills is also on track for a growing role in the offense since out performing Hopkins in week 3.

&#x200B;

Targets are still one area Hopkins leads the team, but has had 8 or less the last four games. Not only are they spreading the ball around more, they are running on average 25 times a game, and involving RBs more in the scoring. 

&#x200B;

In past years, Hopkins was clearly a target hog on the team, but also had less healthy and involved options on the field competing on any given week. This week was a supposed to be a get right game for the Texans, and it absolutely was. The concern though is that Hopkins was not a core focus of that plan. In a game where they scored 53 points, Watson threw 33 passes for 426 yards and 4 touchdowns with only 8 targets/88 yards for Nuk and none in the red zone for Nuk. 

&#x200B;

It's obvious Hopkins has talent and will have big, score leading games, though likley nothing similiar to was Fuller put up this week. That said, there is no reason to really point out of his situation and consistently drastically changing at the moment. 

&#x200B;

If you have Hopkins now, I would be aggressively shopping him around your league. Not that he's a bad player to own, but on name value and current projections **I don't think it's impossible that you could still trade him for a bottom end WR1 and an RB2**. Right now, it's looking extremely likely he doesn't finish as a top ten option on the season, and if he doesn't have a big blow up game this week his value for trading drops significantly.",51,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df188o/for_sale_deandre_hopkins_never_wr1/,4542.841989036401,r/fantasyfootball

(Week 6 DST Rankings),"***Thank You, Dolphins***

College football is finally well into conference play, and that means matchups are generally expected to be more competitive. That said, we still get the occasional 25+ point favorite when a top team in a given conference takes on a lesser team. The Georgia Bulldogs are favored by exactly over the South Carolina Gamecocks. Clemson is such an elite team that they're favored by 27 even over Florida State. We do have one projected non-conference blowout when Louisiana Tech, one of the better teams in Conference USA, and who has only lost to Texas in Austin, takes on UMass, who's never really looked like an FBS team since transitioning from the FCS. Louisiana Tech (also the Bulldogs) are projected to beat the Minutemen by 33. The largest spread this week goes against another New England school who seems to forget they have a football program, UConn. The Huskies take on Tulane this week, the Green Wave aren't a traditional power, but they seem to be on this year. They've beat relatively strong teams like Army and Houston, and their only loss is at Aubrun. Vegas projects Tulane to beat UConn by 34 this week.

Even with mostly conference games happening this week we see spreads double that we see in the NFL this week. As you know the New England team is not at all hapless, and are favored by 16.5 over the Giants this Thursday. This is normally about as large as point spreads go in the NFL. We saw a few 20 point spreads this year, but those are rare. We'd never see something like we do with Tulane, where one team is favored by 34...Well actually there might be one instance. Vegas doesn't have point spreads much more than a week before a given game. I'm fond of using ESPN's FPI mathcup predictor in its stead for long range forecasting. According to FPI, UConn has a 1.8% chance to upset Tulane. Later this year, the aforementioned Patriots will play the most hapless team of all, the Miami Dolphins in Foxborough. We've already seen the Pats play the Phins this year, but it was in Miami and we didn't yet fully understand the depths of Miami's purposeful despair. FPI gives the Dolphins an even 1% chance of winning in the Boston-suburb. That's not wildly better than the 0.5% chance FPI gives Wofford to beat Clemson.

For the most part NFL teams are NFL teams. There are good ones and bad ones, but they all belong in the same league. Unless a team has an especially bad day they'll look like they belong on the same field. The Dolphins are changing that. The Dolphins are playing arguably the league's second worst team in Miami. Nonetheless, Washington is favored by 3.5, and that could go up if Case Keenum plays in lieu of Colt McCoy (apparently Haskins isn't in consideration.) Miami is essentially the NFL's version of playing an FCS team, and that's a godsend for DST streamers. Thank you, Dolphins. 

Sidebar: Sorry to burst fantasy bubbles, but that Patriots-Dolphins matchup is week 17

&nbsp;

***Bye Week Advice***

The Bears, Bills, Colts, and Raiders are on bye this week. We're into what I'd call ""phase 2"" of the season where waiver darlings are less plentiful, so it doesn't hurt as much to stash a DST. The Bears aren't going to repeat last year if Mitch Trubisky has anything to say about it. They've been clearly passed by the Patriots, but they look like a hold still. The Bills are a better real defense than fantasy DST, but they do play the Dolphins in week 7. It's probably worth a stash for that alone. It's unlikely many of you have the Colts or Raiders, but drop them if you do.

[SportsInfo] Most receptions resulting in a first down Chris Godwin - 30 Michael Thomas - 26 Keenan Allen - 24 Cooper Kupp - 23 Travis Kelce - 23 John Brown - 23,,74,0.97,https://twitter.com/sportsinfo_sis/status/1181570123787915266?s=21,4607.425322552522,r/fantasyfootball
Looking to buy low on Mike Evans? Maybe wait a week.,"Mike Evans is obviously coming off the worst game of his career, where he had a big fat zero points on 3 targets. Godwin’s ascension means that the Bucs have a viable 2nd option and Evans is no longer guaranteed his usual workload. However, his target share and air yards are still elite, but it’s not translating. A lot of people see Mike Evans as a buy-low for that reason and I agree, but I think he’ll be an even lower buy next week.

Why? Buying Evans before a Panthers game is a bad idea. The Panthers have been one of Evans’ toughest matchups in his career, especially recently as James Bradberry has taken over the primary duty of covering Evans. His history against the Panthers is not pretty:

| Date     | Primary Cornerback      | Targets | REC | Yards | TDs | PPR Points |
|----------|-----------------|---------|-----|-------|-----|------------|
| 9/7/14   | Antoine Cason   | 9       | 5   | 37    | 0   | 8.7        |
| 2/14/14  | Josh Norman     | 8       | 2   | 13    | 0   | 3.3        |
| 10/4/15  | Josh Norman     | 8       | 3   | 32    | 0   | 6.2        |
| 1/3/16   | Josh Norman     | 9       | 4   | 99    | 0   | 13.9       |
| 10/10/16 | Robert McClain  | 12      | 6   | 89    | 1   | 20.9       |
| 1/1/17   | James Bradberry | 11      | 5   | 65    | 1   | 17.5       |
| 10/29/17 | James Bradberry | 10      | 5   | 60    | 0   | 11         |
| 12/24/17 | James Bradberry | 8       | 6   | 107   | 0   | 16.7       |
| 11/4/18  | James Bradberry | 10      | 1   | 16    | 0   | 2.6        |
| 12/2/18  | James Bradberry | 6       | 4   | 48    | 0   | 8.8        |
| 9/12/19  | James Bradberry | 8       | 4   | 61    | 0   | 10.1       |

Overall, Evans has an average line of 4.1/57.0/0.18 for 10.88 PPR points against the Panthers. However, his best games came during the interlude between Josh Norman leaving and Bradberry developing into a reliable starter. In his last 3 games against Bradberry, Evans has an average line of 3.0/41.7/0 for 7.17 PPR points. His best game against Bradberry came in Bradberry’s rookie year, when he put up just 17.5 points. 

Add in the unknown of a London game and it doesn’t look like this is going to be a rebound week for him. In fact, I’m planning to bench him in leagues where I have a viable alternative. 

I’ll add for the sake of disclosure that I’m a big Mike Evans fan. I own both his home and away jerseys and have him in almost every league I’m in. But I can’t deny the history. He’s always been below average against the Panthers and we can’t count on that changing. So if you own him, it’s logical to worry. If you don’t own him, this isn’t the time to buy him.",107,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/df0cja/looking_to_buy_low_on_mike_evans_maybe_wait_a_week/,4608.65865590175,r/fantasyfootball
Fix My Team! Welcome to a new potential weekly/daily thread for general strategy advice.,"So [we have threads all day long, all week long](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/deyexo/official_index_tue_morning_10082019/) for Add/Drop, and for Trades, and for Who Do I Start? once you’ve added, dropped, and traded.

But what we don’t have at r/fantasyfootball is a thread when you’re not sure if your team *should* be adding and dropping, or making trades, or just staying put.  Something that could encompass questions broader than just ""what should I do this week?"" but rather ""where do I go this season?""

# Until today.

As a moderator, I’ve been wondering if we need a dedicated space for more comprehensive advice questions – the “my team is 1-4 and I’m not quite sure what to do” / “how should I handle this mix of byes and injuries over the next month” / “I’m in a keeper league and I don’t know if I should be buying or selling” sorts of condundrums.

So we’re going to try it and then see whether it belongs as a once-a-week feature, a new addition to the index, or what.

If you have a question about FF strategy, roster composition and the like which doesn’t fit neatly into our existing index threads (Add/Drop, Trade, WDIS, League Questions), **ask it here.**

Especially if you’re relatively new to FF, there’s a lot you might be wondering about how to win at this when repeated rides on the C'mon And Board This Week’s Hype Train just doesn’t seem to be working for you.

But as with the index threads, **please include the following in your posts:**

* Your full roster
* Relevant league specific rules and details (league size, std/PPR, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc
* Your team’s record, and points for/against compared to the rest of your league (i.e., I’m 9th/12 in points scored, but 2nd highest in points against.)
* Whatever specific questions you have. Tell us what you’re wondering about, other than the obvious “I’d like to win as many games as I can.”

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

When answering questions, please make sure to sort by NEW! And **WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS:**

* Do NOT reply with only a player name. Explain your reasoning. Teach others!
* Remember most people know how to look up rankings. They come here for discussion, start a discussion!
* Be nice.  As the Torah says, we were all once strangers in a strange land.  Be the mentor you wish *you* had when you were getting started at this.

Fantasy Football YouTube Channels?,"Hey all, I recently started a YouTube channel (the link is below if anyone is interested, but that's not the point of this post).  As everyone is aware, there's a TON of content out on YouTube.  I got a few content management/digital marketing certifications and have been working on promoting the channel here and there.  What I'd really like to do is start working with other YouTube channels.  I posted something similar a while back and found a really good opportunity thanks to the Reddit community and I thought I'd ask again.

I'm looking to collaborate with other channels.  While working with a huge channel would be ideal, realistically I don't have much to offer in return at the moment in the way of advertising.  I was wondering if you all know anyone (either personally or people you enjoy to follow).  If so, could you throw a link up to their channel in the comments?  I imagine the sweet spot would be 10,000 subscribers or less for collaboration, but I'll take anything.  Fantasy Football Advice and the Fantasy Headliners are the immediate ones that come to my mind.  What else are you all watching?

Best Unowned Team - Week 5 2019,"This is the best lineup using players owned in 5% of leagues or less according to Yahoo. I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules.

* **QB - Chase Daniel - CHI** - 3% - 15.44

* **RB - Chase Edmonds - ARI** - 2% - 16.1

* **RB - Reggie Bonnafon - CAR** - 0% - 14

* **FLEX - Steven Sims Jr. - WAS - WR** - 0% - 13.6

* **D/ST - Oakland** - 1% - 8

* **K - Randy Bullock - CIN** - 0% - 12

This team totalled 6% owned and would've scored 127.64 points.

Every week a new KC WR pops up on the radar. I do love me some Byron Pringle though. All name team potential right there. 

I started a couple leagues with my church this year, one for beginners and one for veterans. I offered to answer questions for the beginners but not many took me up on it. I don't know how it happened but in the fifth round someone selected Reggie Bonnafon. At the time he wasn't even a lock to make the team. I thought I'd have to buy a jersey for his owner if he became fantasy relevant and now he is the number two in CAR. If Run CMC goes down I may be buying his jersey.

Slayton could carve out a role for himself with Shepard, Tate, and Engram working underneath. He could be relevant this week with Shepard doubtful especially, unfortunately they play the Pats at New England on Thursday, so probably not.

"""But Here's the Kicker"" -- Week 6 Rankings","[D/ST post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dezo5v/defensive_maneuvers_week_6_dst_rankings/).

theScore kicker rankings [are here](https://www.thescore.com/news/1851119). (2nd highest accuracy)

# Week 5 Accuracy

Projections were okay last week, despite my below reasons for being disappointed.  Yes, I wish my model had been higher on Tucker and lower on Pineiro (3 XP / 0 FG), but I feel like it's working okay.  On the other hand, this happened:

October 7, **2018**\-- exactly one year ago--  my weekly kicker rankings took a beating: *""the typically very reliable Crosby missed attempts from 41, 42, 38 and 56 yards in the kicker-friendly conditions of the domed Ford Field""*.  Nobody else had him ranked near #1 as I did at that time, so it was... painful.

October 7, **2019**\-- Yesterday, it was almost a repeat but with Gould (and Slye, and Santos).  Gould had become my #1 (latest Vegas lines).  Nice weather, ordinary low wind speed, could've been 20 points... Instead, **3 missed FGs**.  *""Three misses? Gould made 72 of 75 field goals in his previous two seasons with the 49ers, the most accurate two-season stretch in NFL history with a minimum of 50 attempts.  On Monday, however, the kicker ranked second in NFL history in accuracy pushed a 47-yard attempt right, came up short on a 52-yarder and had a 32-yard attempt blocked.""*

But actually, the tougher pill to swallow [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dbt5k6/but_heres_the_kicker_week_5_rankings_tuesday/) was my #7-- Santos-- who nobody else ranked above #20: and he ends up with -3 points from **4 missed** FGs?!   I know many of you are also upset that Slye missed 2 FGs too.  Two weeks ago it was Prater. Last week it was Gonzalez... come on!  These guys are getting in position.  And it's not even like these last two are known for poor accuracy (even Santos was above 80% historically). But they haven't sealed the deal for us in the way we hope.

[ By choosing my top-ranked kickers instead of bottom-ranked ones, you could have reasonably expected 1.4 points higher in week 5.  ESPN gave the best advice last week, for the first time.](https://i.redd.it/wnim4zjwgbr31.jpg)

Lev Bell has an amazing FF playoff schedule,"Bell plays the Bengals, Dolphins, Ravens, and Steelers during the playoffs. All have below average defenses. 3 of them allow higher than average rushing yards (Ravens have above average run defense, but they have also faced fewer attempts).

&#x200B;

Not to mention that the 3 games leading up to the playoffs the Jets play the Raiders, Redskins, and Giants. Once the Jets get through the next 3 weeks (Cowboys, Patriots, Jaguars)... he will likely explode.

Let’s appreciate some quality resources,"There’s a good chance this post will get passed up or removed, but I’d like to point out some quality users and resources that have helped me have my best fantasy season so far. 

First, let’s thank u/CountryOfEarth for his well put together WR/CB matchup sheet. If you haven’t seen it let me just tell you it’s worth a look every week. I can’t speak to the accuracy of it week to week, but again, you won’t be disappointed when it helps you decide your 2nd WR or a flex play that week. 

Secondly, Mr u/MyronGains7 has a rolling matchup chart that breaks down each position in several formats. I highly recommend this as well. 

Lastly, macker.co is a projection table that allows you to sort by position as well as breaks down the matchups. Inside of those breakdowns you can see the previous weeks data as well as the following four games’ projections. 

All in all, fantasy football is largely luck. I’m sure most of you saw one of your bottom four put up 200 plus points this week. Everything little thing helps, and I just wanted to pass this along to my fellow fantasy ballers. Good luck, don’t rage if you’re 1-4 right now (wait till next week then if you lose it’s just not your year lol), take a look at these few gold mines of information and hopefully it’ll help you in the weeks to come.",22,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dezr0q/lets_appreciate_some_quality_resources/,4657.341989401976,r/fantasyfootball

"Delanie Walker owners, is it time to pivot or are you riding it out?","After a hot start, Walker has certainly cooled off. 

Seeing only 4 total targets in the last two weeks is a bit concerning. But with the volatility of the position who can Delanie Walker owners turn to?",58,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dezeot/delanie_walker_owners_is_it_time_to_pivot_or_are/,4687.175322814783,r/fantasyfootball
OBJ - Obviously Benching Jr?,"What is everyone doing with OBJ? He's been relegated to WR2 status by Yahoo but in actuality he's playing like a WR3. He was a high 2nd round pick for most. 2nd Round, 16 overall for me.

In standard he has put up 7.10, 22.10, 5.6, 2, and 3 points.

Marcus Maye of the Jets got burned on an 89 yard TD from OBJ. That's 14.9 points so without that Beckham has 7.1 points until then.

If he was any other WR really he wouldn't be good enough to not start. He's on the Can't Cut list (even though you aren't dropping him.) You aren't benching him because he will put up a 20 spot if you do.

Try to trade? The best I'm getting is straight up for Terry McLaurin or Terry/John Brown.

What are fellow OBJ owners doing?",133,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dez59i/obj_obviously_benching_jr/,4710.725322834651,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Tuesday Waiver Wire] - Tue Morning, 10/08/2019","#Tuesday Waiver Wire Thread  

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it’s worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.   


--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you'd like to discuss something outside of this theme, please try checking the [latest Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day) for a thread that might be more suitable for you. If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

For those in Yahoo! leagues,"I hope this isn't redundant but I encountered this scenario as I looked over my teams so I figured I'd share. In both of my Yahoo! teams, I roster Devin Singletary, who I'd designated to IR prior to last week's outings. Given that they're on a bye week 6, moving him out of my IR becomes a moot proposition, despite his injury designation.

What this leaves me with is a spare bench spot that could (should?) be accessible for a healthy player or a spot to play defense with 👺.

Anyway, just a little hiccup I thought might be advantageous & figured I'd share",22,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dexw8h/for_those_in_yahoo_leagues/,4842.608656402429,r/fantasyfootball

Why you should consider Kenyan Drake this week.,"Here is Kenyan Drakes usage/ touches through the first four weeks versus Ballage’s usage:

Week 1- Drake 54%-6 touches, Ballage 40%

Week 2- Drake 55%-11 touches, Ballage 34%

Week 3- Drake 64%-15 touches, Ballage 35%

Week 4- Drake 54%-12 touches, Ballage 15% (Walton over took him here) 

So clearly it’s an even time share, however their production has been different as Ballage has struggled with no more than one catch in any game and no double digit rushes. Ballage has played himself out of a job with dropped passes and bad running vision. 

Drake has shown great burst, hands, and vision when the football is in his hands. He is clearly the best player on that team.

Drake’s upside is limited due to Miami’s issues with their O-line and potentially one of the worst defenses in NFL history. But as the primary pass catching back he won’t be phased out of the game plan. He is getting more touches as he begins to win that backfield and should be started in certain matchups. One of those matchups happen to be this week.

Below is what the Redskins have given up to each RB this year:

Week 1 vs Eagles: 26 for 116 yards, 6 catches for 29 yards.

Week 2 vs Cowboys: 27 for 133 yards 1 TD,           3 catches for 12 yards.

Week 3 vs Bears: 18 for 67 yards, 5 catches for 40 yards.

Week 4 vs Giants: 31 for 108 yards 1 TD,                6 catches for 55 yards 1 TD

Week 5 vs Pats: 27 for 130 yards 1 TD, 10 catches for 107 1 TD

As you can see the redskins have faced a lot of different backfields and haven given up production to each one. If you have bye weeks or injuries, consider Kenyan Drake for a safe floor/high upside flex this week!",55,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/desud7/why_you_should_consider_kenyan_drake_this_week/,5383.25865653356,r/fantasyfootball
ESPN Scoring for IDP Leagues May be incorrect depending on how your league scores Stuffs/TFL,"TLDR at the bottom. Note: this situation will likely only apply to your league if you have an IDP league and provide a point for a TFL/Stuff.

For one of my ESPN leagues, our league commish discovered that IDPs are not receiving credit for an assisted tackle for loss/assisted stuff. We’ve been in this league for years, and have had this scoring in place for a while. 

I’ll use Blake Martinez Week 3 (Packers v Broncos) as my example, since the person owning Martinez lost by 0.1 point: this correction will give them the win.

Martinez had 12 Total Tackles, 8 of which were solo, and 2.5 tackles for loss. In our league, he should have scored 14.5 points (bonus point for every 5 tackles), but ESPN only has him scored at 14 points. When comparing the two, he was only credited for 2 stuffs instead of 2.5 in the fantasy scoring. 

We reviewed last season and confirmed that players were always receiving 0.5 on a TFL, so this is definitely a glitch with ESPN’s scoring. Our commish has reached out to notify ESPN, but I just thought I’d let the group know. Thankfully the other games within 2 points were unaffected, but one game outcome was changed based on our findings.

TLDR; ESPN isn’t giving half points on TFL/Stuffs in IDP leagues. If your game was close, double check your players",4,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/desmau/espn_scoring_for_idp_leagues_may_be_incorrect/,5401.691989882787,r/fantasyfootball

Statistically (in)Significant: Week 5,"Welcome to Statistically (in)Significant, the place to find great stats that probably only matter at the water cooler (or bar). Each week I'll dig through the stats of the week gone by and deliver you some choice conversation starters. All fantasy stats are standard Yahoo scoring, unless otherwise noted.

&nbsp;

**16 Point Fantasy Floor**

&nbsp;

This season, only 3 players in the NFL have a solid fantasy floor. The always reliable Patrick Mahomes, even when his team scores a scant 13 points, has not scored less than 18 fantasy points all season. The other two guys are a bit more surprising. Kyler Murray and Gardner Minshew II. Murray notched his first win on Sunday against the hapless Bengals. He had his best day statistically as a fantasy QB, not turning the ball over and gaining 93 yards on the ground to go with a TD. Murray ended the day as the QB6 to Minshew’s QB8. Both guys are rookies, one was the first overall draft pick and the other is clearly a future hall-of-famer and worthy successor to Blake Bortles in the eyes of Jason from The Good Place. Minshew had a tough matchup against fellow rookie phenom Kyle Allen on Sunday. Unfortunately for Minshew, he doesn’t have Christian McCaffrey on his team. Speaking of the guy leading ALL fantasy players and the MVP race at the moment…

&nbsp;

**866 Yards from Scrimmage**

&nbsp;

Christian McCaffrey had himself a game on Sunday. His 237 yards from scrimmage and 3 TDs were actually only good for the 3rd best point total on a day with huuuuge points, but more on them later. McCaffrey is now on pace for 2770 yards from scrimmage this season, smashing the record of 2509 set by Chris Johnson in 2009. So far, McCaffrey leads the league in rushing yards and, second in receiving yards among RBs. He is the top point scorer in all of fantasy football, with 128.60 points, just nudging out QBs Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson. Next up, the Buccaneers, the only team that has managed to hold McCaffrey to under 23.9 points this season. I expect him to have a much better performance this time around.

&nbsp;

**6 Players Above 30 Fantasy Points**

&nbsp;

This week was all about big performances. The early games, and there were a lot of them (10!), had the Texans hanging 53 points on Atlanta. Along the way, Deshaun Watson threw 5 TDs and notched 41.74 fantasy points, a season high at the position. Three of those scores were via the hands of Will Fuller V, who had his own monster day of 217 yards and 3 TDs for 39.70 points. This was more than double his season points total so far, having not exceeded 6.9 points in a game all year. Falcons QB Matt Ryan continued his excellent, but quiet year. His 32.9 points on Sunday was excellent for fantasy players, but a terrible losing effort for his team. Ryan also gets an honorable mention in regards to my earlier stat about QB floors – his lowest game this year is 15.68. Michael Thomas put up a ho-hum 30+ point game, showing that he’s good no matter who’s throwing him the ball. I already mentioned Christian McCaffrey, who was sitting on top of the RB list this week until Aaron Jones had something to say about it. Jones basically beat the Cowboys all by himself. Putting up a whopping 42.2 points, he had 182 yards from scrimmage and 4 TDs on the ground. Aaron Rodgers owners may not be thrilled, but clearly, we all see who the real A-a-ron is in Green Bay right now.

&nbsp;

**35 Fantasy Points**

&nbsp;

But wait, there was one more entry to the 30 points and over club! A D/ST had a huge day and surprisingly it wasn’t the odds-on favorite New England Patriots against the hapless Washington Redskins. The Philadelphia Eagles just dismantled the New York Jets, limiting them to only 9 first downs, putting up 10 sacks and scoring TDs on both an interception and a fumble recovery. They added another interception just for fun and because, apparently, it’s easy to pick on Luke Falk. The Jets need Sam Darnold back as soon as possible. Maybe Darnold can get tips from Jason Witten on how to rehab one’s spleen. I don’t really see this performance as indicative of the Eagles getting better, but rather it just shows how bad the Jets are. The Eagles play Minnesota, Dallas and Buffalo coming up, and I see no advantage to keeping them around this week. Continue streaming, friends!

&nbsp;

**3 of the Top 10**

&nbsp;

Finally, a bit about kickers in fantasy football. Only 3 of the top 10 performers in Week 5 were owned in our drinkfive fantasy league. Those three kickers are owned in at least 78% of Yahoo leagues. The remaining 7 kickers have an average ownership of just about 19%, showing that nobody knows what the hell a kicker is going to do week to week, mostly because it’s not up to them! This is just my latest entry to my argument that kickers probably don’t need to have anything to do with fantasy football. Any Sunday, you’ve got an equal chance, it seems, to have a guy like Dan Bailey (10% owned) put up the same amount of points as a guy like Justin Tucker (99% owned). It’s just ridiculous that 2 of the top 5 kickers on the year are owned in fewer than 25% of Yahoo leagues, Matt Gay (22%) and Zane Gonzalez (17%).

Will Hooper end up TE1?,"This guy is the #1 TE in .5 PPR and has scored more than kelce, kittle, and ertz.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

Patriots started using 2 TE sets alot yesterday,"I've been streaming a TE for the season and am desperate for hope. According to PFF, patriots do not really run plays with two TEs in their lineup. Their most used lineup is 11 personnel (1RB, 1TE and 3 WR) . Through the first 4 games the patriots only ran 12 plays with two TE's (either  12 or 22 personnel  meaning 1RB2TE or 2RB2TE). Yesterday they ran 18 plays with either combination and one of their Tight Ends scored a TD\* . Patriots fans, can you maybe shed some light on what can we expect from this offense and if we can hope that Belicheck utilizes tight ends more going forward? Last time they had two TE's in NE they were both very good. I didnt know how to utilize PFF  8 years ago when Hernandez and Gronk were ballin out but I hope that this new 2TE  set with Lacosse and Izzo could be something promising  and maybe also why they didnt sign Ben Watson a roster spot. Would appreciate any input, thank you!!

My first stupid “what about x player post” - NYG WR Darius Slayton.,"I’ll keep this short because I’m lazy BUT I have a few valid reasons for posting (which I’m sure this sub will rip up).

Shepard is reported to miss multiple weeks with his concussion.

Dimes has targeted him 12 times already - that’s 4 per game and could go up to 6 with Shepard out. Not massive but I’ll take these targets on a deep threat guy with a nose for the end zone.

The kid can take the top off the defense with 4.39 speed and a 40.5 inch vert and likely a 9 inch....nevermind.

The Giants really don’t have a deep threat on the team. Engram and Tate are more route running guys and with Saquan returning soon, it could mean a lot of 1 on 1 matchups with teams having to account for the guys I just mentioned.

I looked at his college stats and they look low as fuck so that’s not good so let’s just not look at these numbers.",22,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/der198/my_first_stupid_what_about_x_player_post_nyg_wr/,5531.041990252336,r/fantasyfootball

how much can tyreek hill already boost KC offense?,"Hi everyone, casual FF/DFS player here and was wondering coming into last nights game whether Indianapolis  would try to slow the game down as much as possible in order to neutralize KC offensive weapons. With everyone saying this game was going to be high scoring, it ended up being the lowest game total of the weekend. 

That being said, if teams finally start to attack the KC defense using the run and playing slow, how much does Tyreeks return to the offense  really change things if KC’s time of possession is limited ? it seems like that is finally proving to be the recipe to beat them  and I don’t see why teams shouldn’t follow that game script (unless they don’t have offensive talent to do so). Mahomes was already efficient without tyreek in the lineup making weekly FF/DFS stars out of Hardman and Robinson. In a way this is a Tyreek hill ROS, but ultimately a KC offense ROS question  as well . 

Thanks and appreciate everyone’s input!",32,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/deqbk7/how_much_can_tyreek_hill_already_boost_kc_offense/,5583.841990331809,r/fantasyfootball

"With Watkins out and Hill returning, what are your thoughts on the rest of Chief’s receivers going forward?","With Watkins going out of the game due to injury on Monday, fantasy owners of the remaining healthy receivers undoubtedly salivated at the thought of their guy stepping in to fill the WR1 void in Kansas City’s high powered offence.

Enter: Byron Pringle.

The heir to the Pringle’s Chip Family fortune, Byron Pringle, came out of no where to drop his Pringle’s can sized dong on the Monday night table to the tune of 6/9, 103 yards, and a TD.

Now is the time to go after Christian Kirk,"I think this is one of the pieces that struggling teams should be targeting to help get them back on track. Kirk’s value will never be lower than it is right now. Coming off his worst game of the season against Seattle (and the ankle injury) he’s currently sitting at 82% ownership and -6% dropped the past week. 

Assuming the ankle was indeed minor (which is what was reported) and he’s ready to go this week - the next few matchups include: Atlanta, NYG, and NO. We know the falcons and giants are cake walks - but I think the saints can be lumped in there as well considering what Godwin did / assuming Lattimore will shadow Fitz. 

His target share is nuts already this season and Kyler & this offense have (largely) shown improvement each game. Likewise there have been two separate instances where he was tackled at the 1 yard line. If he scores even once, the perceived value is something else entirely. But as it stands now - I think the average owner views him as a low level WR2 / high end WR3. Considering his schedule, talent, and situation - I think he has the potential to be an absolute stud ROS and be the guy that jumpstarts struggling teams to a winning record.

Don’t sell Will Fuller!!!,"Disclaimer: I am a Fuller owner and have been a huge fan ever since Watson got there so take this with a grain of salt.

Some stats: Fuller is 4th in air yards, has outsnapped Hopkins the last two weeks, and a 24% target share to Hopkins 28% (definitely bolstered by week 5).
Also there were a couple of occasions where the Texans went 13 or 22 personnel with Fuller as the one receiver instead of Hopkins which I thought was odd.

My opinion: Fuller meshes well with the play style of Watson. Watson loves to scramble around and throw the deep ball which plays more to Fuller’s strength than to Hopkins who is more of a possession receiver. Don’t take this the wrong way though, Fuller will not drop 40+ every week, but he has also been underperforming just like Hopkins for most of the year. If you get a great offer then by all means take it, but don’t undervalue Fuller’s ROS potential.

Quick edit: even if we remove weeks 1 and 5 (Hopkins big week and Fullers big week) Fuller only has 3 less target and 3% less target share. The numbers were even closer when stills was there (so minus week 4 as well) just 1 less target and a 2% target share difference. Obviously it’s a small sample size but they are damn near identical and Fuller has more big play potential than Hopkins",90,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/deop3h/dont_sell_will_fuller/,5697.291990653674,r/fantasyfootball

[UPDATE] Recent changes to ESPN Multi-League Tool!,"Y'all may remember [my little post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/daw38r/i_made_some_scripts_that_can_aide_owners_with/) from just about a week ago with a tool that would congregate your scores into a single scoreboard so you could tell if you were winning or losing in all of your ESPN leagues as well as by how much. It also had the functionality to pull all of your lineups across all of your leagues to generate a list of players that you are starting but that are also starting against you. This would be useful to help limit expectations or provide that ""coin-flip"" decision as to who you should start.

There were some shortcomings with the tool initially, the largest two were the lack of support for private leagues and the lack of a configuration file to separate the scripts from user input. Thankfully, this latest version fixes those and adds some minor improvements.

With Week 5 drawing to a close tonight, I encourage anyone with multiple ESPN leagues to check it out for Week 6! It's a neat little tool that is always being worked on and tweaked as I'm constantly looking for improvements and new features. Any feature requests would be greatly appreciated!

"NFL Replay System is inherently flawed, with fantasy implications","*Disclaimer: This is not a straight up fantasy football topic, but it definitely has some serious fantasy implications... Also I'm not sure where else would be the best place to post this. Apologies in advance if it's long or poorly indexed.*

I have hated the NFL's replay system for years, and my number one complaint is that the purpose doesn't match the execution. What is and should be the only goal of replay? To get the call right. Instead, the NFL has turned it into a strategy.

Coaches get 2 challenges, and a 3rd if they go 2-for-2. What if 4 plays go incorrectly against your team? So coaches have to decide when getting a call right is worth a precious challenge. This is especially true in the new era of pass interference review. If a bad call on 2nd & 7 early in the second quarter robs you of 5 or 6 yards, do you challenge? Is it worth it? Probably not. So this bad call goes accepted by everyone, in the hopes you get a bigger, more important play to challenge later. Meanwhile, the team who was wronged fails to convert on 3rd & 7, and the butterfly effect occurs. Momentum, confidence, time of possession all come into play. *(And your receiver may have been robbed of a PPR and a few yards.)*

There are dozens of examples, but late in the Cowboys-Packers game yesterday, Amari Cooper had a tapdancing catch on the sideline that was ruled incomplete. Jason Garrett challenged the play, and was furious that he even had to. He got an unsportsmanlike penalty, and while he ""won"" the challenge, a 27 yd gain turned into a 12 yd gain once the penalty was assessed. *(Note: this play had little effect on the outcome of the game, but fantasy-wise, it did give Cooper 27 yards, plus a PPR, if applicable.)*

Using replay as a strategy and not a means of ensuring the call is correct is wrong. It has even bigger implications when a team is out of challenges and gets ""victimized"" by a bad call -- made by a human referee -- late in a game, and before booth reviews kick in at 2:00. The NFL is basically admitting this system is flawed, by making reviews automatic and/or mandatory on scoring plays, turnovers and in the final 2 minutes of a half or OT.

Finally, the review process itself is marred by inherent objectivity, especially when plays are broken down frame-by-frame at super slow motion speeds.

As a Steelers fan, I watched the Ravens game yesterday, and two specific calls went to review, either by challenge or booth. (One was the Devin Bush interception. The other I think was a Diontae Johnson completion and fumble OB.) Both times, the CBS referee expert (Gene Steratore?) stated that he would have made the call the other way. So basically, if Steratore were still an official and he was working the game, it would have completely changed the landscape of it, or possibly the outcome. *(Again, both plays have fantasy implications, to PIT DEF/ST or Johnson owners.)*

I would like to see the NFL adopt NCAA replay rules, where ALL plays are reviewed by officials, automatically. With so much of a human element to officiating, no system is perfect, but using a limited number of reviews as a strategy is no way to officiate a 16-game season with so much at stake. *Get it right. Not get it right if you still have a challenge remaining.* You might as well give coaches 2 chances per game to flip a coin when their team is flagged for holding, and if they call it correctly they get to negate the penalty. (Add a third coin flip if you're 2-for-2!)",28,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/demtiv/nfl_replay_system_is_inherently_flawed_with/,5830.125324300925,r/fantasyfootball
It seems Jordan Howard has overtaken Miles Sanders as the #Eagles No. 1 running back.,,131,0.97,https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/10/has-jordan-howard-overtaken-miles-sanders-as-eagles-top-rb-heres-what-doug-pederson-said.html,5838.008657650153,r/fantasyfootball
Grab Pittsburgh D/ST if available...,"In Yahoo they are 27% percent owned even though they are #8 in scoring. 

Blitz-burgh is a sack machine having garnered over 50+ sacks in the previous two years and are on pace (19 total currently) for 60+ this year. 

As for turnovers they are 3rd in picks (6), 1st in fumbles recovered (6) and tied for 1st with 12 overall. 

And the juiciest part is that their final 6 games are @Cle,@ Cin, Cle, @Ari (Wk 14), Buf (Wk 15) and @NYJ (Wk16). 

Long story short, buy early on Pit b/c after their game against LAC, they have a BYE and then play MIA and whoever takes them for that game won't let go of them.",55,0.65,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/demomv/grab_pittsburgh_dst_if_available/,5839.475324336688,r/fantasyfootball
Albert Wilson saw 4 targets on his 6 snaps before exiting with an injury week 1. Should return week 6. Is he worth a stash in deep leagues?,"I know it's a different quarterback, but with the Dolphins needing to get rid of the ball quickly, the Dolphins always playing catch-up and him being in the slot, is he worth a stash at least for next week against Washington and see how he does?",11,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/demkam/albert_wilson_saw_4_targets_on_his_6_snaps_before/,5847.875324336687,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Simple Questions and League Issues] - Mon Afternoon, 10/07/2019","**DO NOT post Who Do I Start, Add Drop, or Trade questions in this thread; find the appropriate thread within the [INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day).**

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only a yes or no. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.

Why Ted Ginn Jr. should be on your radar.,"Let me preface this by briefly talking about Will Fuller and his monster day against the falcons. 

Prior to this game Will Fuller had a very ugly start to the fantasy season averaging just 6.3 pts per game in 0.5 ppr,with the highest points scored being 7.9pts against the saints. He literally scored more this one game than in all 4 previous games combined , and is the first player since Julio in 2017 to put up a 50 pt fantasy game in full point ppr. I know that it was against an ugly falcons secondary, who have an average player grade of 59.4 (55.1 if you exclude Deion Jones as he has a 85.8 rating and boosts the whole average up nearly 5 whole points) , but impressive no doubt.

Ted Ginn will be playing this secondary twice with Drew Brees hopefully back at the helm ,in weeks 10 and 13. 

Here are some stats for wr2s vs the falcons so far.

&#x200B;

|*player*|*receptions*|*rec yards*|*yds/avg*|*rec tds*|*0.5 ppr points*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Steffon Diggs\*|2|37|18.5|0|4.7|
|Mack Hollins\*|5|50|10|0|7.5|
|Zach Pascal|2|53|26.5|1|12.3|
|A.J Brown|3|94|31.3|2|22.9|
|Will Fuller V|14|217|15.5|3|46.7|

\*Keanu Neal still active these games, suffered a torn Achilles week 2.

&#x200B;

As you can see the falcons secondary has allowed more yards/tds each week than the previous week,this is not a group of DBs that look to be getting any better. I am in no way saying that Ginn is going to replicate Will Fuller's performance, but with Michael Thomas drawing double teams just as Hopkins did week 5, and an average 20.36 yards per reception allowed to WR2s :

Ted has an opportunity to

* turn on the Ol' burners
* Scorch the falcons
* Propel us into fantasy playoffs

Is Mike Evans still a must-start next week against Carolina?,"I know the mantra is ""start your studs,"" but IMO a ""stud"" is someone who can be counted on for at least *some* points when they play an entire game at full strength. Even if the matchup is tough and the QB is under pressure. 

Next week, Evans likely draws shadow coverage from James Bradberry. Evans has typically struggled against Bradberry, and he just got completely erased by Lattimore and the Saints D. In fact, aside from one broken play against the Rams, he has scored a grand total of 4 points over the last 2 weeks and has half as many targets as Godwin over that span. 

I understand that Evans was a high draft pick and most owners won't have a clear-cut better option, but what if you have someone decent on your bench with a juicy matchup?",153,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/del6ds/is_mike_evans_still_a_muststart_next_week_against/,5947.441991380851,r/fantasyfootball

Why you shouldn't be worried about Lamar Jackson,"A lot of people are freaking out about his performance last week. Here's my take as to why you shouldn't freak out about him.

For one thing, you didn't invest a ton of draft capital in Lamar. He went around the 10th and 12th in most rounds, and he just put QB8+ for 4 out of the 5 weeks he's played, so if anything he has outperformed his ADP.

However, last game might have gotten people worried and here's why i don't think you should be. Lamar threw 5 INTs in his last two games. Against the browns he threw 2, one of which was a garbage time throw out of desperation, and the other one was a mis catch. Last game, he threw 3 more - 2 of which were the WRs fault - ball were mis-caught, toppled in the air, and intercepted. Had those been caught, add in 4 points to Lamars week 5 total of 11points, and you have a 15 point QB game.

Now is that a great score? No, by no means. And we can talk about what ifs all we want, but the ink is dry, he did throw the INTs and ended the week with 11 points.

My overarching point, however, is that this is Lamars floor. With only one passing TD, 3 INT, <200 PaYrds, and just a bad game in general, he still got 11 points. He is still rushing more than any other QB, and that is why you drafted him.

He plays the bengals twice in the next five weeks, as well as the hawks, NE and Houston. The only matchup I'm worried about is the NE one. Houston and the seahawks are average against QB, and lamar should still see around 20 points against them.

TLDR; Lamar will be just fine ROS, fantasy wise at least. His rushing abilities gives him a safe floor for a QB, and his upcoming fixtures are favorable (save for NE.)",31,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/deku4n/why_you_shouldnt_be_worried_about_lamar_jackson/,5972.1586581349375,r/fantasyfootball

"Greg Olsen ""What You Doin' to Me, Baby?"" Megathread.","As we all know, the tight end position is very important in fantasy. It can often make or break your season. And after posting 16 catches, 221 yards, and 2 TDs through the first three weeks, Greg Olsen has posted only 2 two catches for five yards in the past two games. What's worse, after average over 8 targets a game in the first three weeks, he's averaged **two targets** in the past two games. In yesterday's game against the Jaguars, Greg Olsen had **zero targets** despite being in 98% of snaps. 

And while one would think it's the QB shift, Greg Olsen's best game this season is with Kyle Allen under center. 

After the hot start, there was the feeling the perhaps Greg Olsen could have been a savior to those who drafted their tight ends a little too late this season. But now Greg Olsen is feeling like a volatile boom/bust guy with with a floor as low as the Netherrealm.

Some advice from an Eagles fan for those of you who are cursed with trying to figure out our backfield,"Obviously the Eagles backfield is a pretty frustrating mess for fantasy owners, so I figured I'd provide some perspective as someone who watches every game.

Basically Jordan Howard is the better running back. He's averaging far more yards per carry, and he's just visually better on the field. His vision and power are leagues ahead of Sanders, who has shown rookie struggles at finding the hole.

That being said, Howard is never going to become a week to week bellcow. He's basically a zero in the passing game, and Sanders has shown some talent as a receiver. Against the Jets they split snaps evenly, Howard got significantly more carries but they had the same number of touches because Sanders got 4 receptions to Howard's zero.

What this means is their usage is likely to vary heavily based on the strength of the opposing defense. Last week the Eagles found a flaw in the Packers rush defense, so they let Howard pound the rock against them.    But next week the Eagles are up against the Vikings who have allowed 3.6 yards per carry. I'd expect them to lean into the passing game, and Sanders to get more snaps.

The final thing to take note of is Howard has gotten basically all of the redzone touches and will likely continue to.

TL,DR: Howard is only likely to get good volume against teams that struggle against the run, and will split carries in other games. Don't expect much from Sanders until he shows he can improve on the ground",21,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/deifb0/some_advice_from_an_eagles_fan_for_those_of_you/,6170.4086585005125,r/fantasyfootball
What’s wrong with Julio’s usage lately? In the last two weeks Ryan has attempted 99 passes and Julio has only received 14 targets.,"As the title says, Julio’s stats these last two weeks have been poor: a combined 7 catches from 14 targets for 94 scoreless yards. And yet Ryan has been throwing the ball plenty. Last week he attempted 46 passes against the Titans, this weekend he attempted 53 passes against the Texans. 

In fact Julio has only been tied 4th in targets the last two weeks as Ryan has really been spreading the ball around. The actual order in targets goes Hooper (19), Sanu (17), Ridley (15), then Freeman and Julio (14 apiece), and then Ito Smith (10). Combined that’s 89 targets to the six of them these past two weeks, so basically they are the passing game.

I haven’t watched any Falcons games, but naturally I’m worried as a Julio owner. Is Julio deliberately not being used as much in the gameplan because he’s being double teamed? Is he running a lot of deep routes while Ryan goes with the likes of Freeman, Sanu, and Hooper on the shorter stuff because Ryan either chooses to play it safe or has to dump it because the oline can’t hold up for longer developing plays? 

Hoping to start a discussion here because I didn’t see Julio specifically mentioned when I used the search bar, and he’s one of the top WRs in the game. Any insight from anyone who has watched Atlanta’s last two games would be welcomed too!",160,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dei6q4/whats_wrong_with_julios_usage_lately_in_the_last/,6194.841991885503,r/fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

Is it considered bad etiquette to loot a winless team?,"I don’t like to take advantage of a desperate team’s situation in “fire sale” mode, as their roster is typically full of underperforming stars (like D-Hop) or injured players soon returning. But I have found that other teams in my leagues typically get away with murder and make lopsided deals with these poor struggling owners. So, if I don’t, they will. I’m not really talking about making buy low deals but rather, taking part in the systematic gutting of a desperate team.

I don’t think it’s the honorable thing to do but wondering how people deal (or don’t deal) with desperate teams...whether after the first few weeks or teams out of it after a couple of months.

Making sense of the Kansas City backfield,"Now that Damien Williams is back it confuses the backfield exponentially for fantasy plays. This was their stats today vs. Indy:

Damien Williams: 9 rush att, 23 rush yards, 4 targets, 3 receptions, 15 receiving yards.

Darrell Williams : no rushes or receptions (played 13 snaps).

Shady McCoy: 2 targets, 2 receptions, 23 receiving yards, 1 fumble.

I assume Shady's limited use was at least in part due to the fumble, and none of the backs were very productive which is rare in this offense, but I feel like Darrell Williams isn't even with holding onto anymore unless you have space. Shady went from a RB2 to someone I'm not even sure if I can start. Am I missing anything and do you agree?",64,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/defqju/making_sense_of_the_kansas_city_backfield/,6490.191992084186,r/fantasyfootball
Devonta Freeman - sell high?,"PPR league: His rushing numbers are absolutely disgusting aside from week 3 but the past 2 weeks he’s been solid because of the pass catching (18 points back to back weeks).

Colts Craze,"As all of you know, the colts beat patty mahomes and the chiefs tonight. I didn’t watch the whole game, but looked at the stats afterwords. I saw Mack had 29 for carries, for 132 yards. No touchdowns. Not too sure yet where to value Mack, due to his health and usage in blowout games. 

Another stat I saw was TY’s 37 yards. As someone who owns ty, I figured he would be the main point in their passing game, however only hauled in 4 receptions.

Starting and rostering both Cooper and Gallup,"So i took a chance at WW on grabbing Gallup over Marvin Jones Golden Tate and Robby Anderson, despite being a Cooper owner. I know Gallup didnt start playing well today until Cooper went out after that one hit to his ankle, but both starting picking up their game and got a TD each in a second half shootout. Is it so crazy to suggest not only rostering but starting both Cooper and Gallup ROS. After all the worst case is that you have one of them rostered in case one of them goes down. I did this last year with Fuller and DHop and went 4-0 for the weeks I had both until Fuller got injured. I would argue this year Gallup and Cooper fit that role and the gameplan in Dallas allows for this as so far 3/3 games that they both play together have been getting \~10 fantasy points at least. This is in contrast to what I am seeing right now with Godwin and Evans as so far only one of them gets to be eating week-to-week.

Cheifs Fantasy Matchups ROS,"It seems like the consensus was that the Cheifs would get in shootouts every match with how much offensive firepower they have, but we've seen differently the past two weeks. Teams are starting to stick to a heavy run game and pressure defense to try and get Mahomes out of any sort of rhythm. Is this a strategy that looks like will be adopted when playing against the Cheifs? Of course there will inevitably be breakout plays and games because the Cheifs offense is just too talented to be stagnated consistently.

Does it seem like this will lower the potential points on both sides of the ball if it's the new strategy to slow dowm the Cheifs?

As much as I want to set and forget with him, there’s the issue of AJ Green returning. Surely with the Bengals almost depressing offense, we should expect a decline to low end WR2 territory with him sharing touches with Green.

Can we stop with the Darrel Williams fantasy now?,"I get that he did a lot of great work when damien fell, and you hope thats enough to make him startable. But he just isn't that guy unless theres an injury.

The Chiefs are a passing offense. Even when theyre up 3 scores, Mahomes likes to throw. That alone makes KC RBs more challenging.

Shady did just as much work as Darrel and is still learning the offense. Hes just going to get more involved, not less.

Damien was/is the starter for a reason. They let him sit out so long for a reason. They're not giving up on him cause of one minor injury.

""Well we don't know what they're gonna do til we see Damien play!"" We did know, and this game is your confirmation. 

""You don't know what the Chiefs will do! They could rework it to have more run plays with Darrel!"" - no. They wont. Why on earth would they? Cause Darrel was forced in to the endzone from the 1 after multiple attempts? Come on. They have a formula that works for them. They're not gonna rewrite the playbook because you think Darrel is neat and you need your first fantasy win.

New record for highest scoring potential team,"A while back (about 4 years ago), I did some posts detailing the highest scoring potential lineups. I nicknamed this the [260 Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3muijn/the_260_club_update_and_new_entries/), using ESPN standard scoring (no PPR), and the largest potential lineup that was found was from Week 4 of the 2002 season:

Position|Name|Points
---------|----------|----------
QB | Trent Green | 41.2
RB | Shaun Alexander | 53.1
RB | LaDainian Tomlinson | 35.7
WR | Donald Driver | 23.2
WR | Corey Bradford | 21.7
TE | Tony Gonzalez | 32.0
Flex | Fred Taylor | 29.7
DST | Raiders | 24.0
K | Jason Hanson | 14.0
 | TOTAL | 274.6

As of right now, I believe we have a new champion in this category, even before considering the Sunday night and Monday night games:

Position|Name|Points
---------|----------|----------
QB | Deshaun Watson | 45.7
RB | Aaron Jones | 42.2
RB | Christian McCaffery | 41.7
WR | Will Fuller V | 39.7
WR | Michael Thomas | 30.2
TE | Darren Fells | 14.0
Flex | *Amari Cooper* | 28.6
DST | Eagles | 36.0
K | Justin Tucker | 16
 | TOTAL | 293.4


NOTE: I cannot find the ""old"" ESPN standard scoring for defense, where a DST would receive up to 5 points for a shutout, and up to 5 points for allowing less than 100 yards. I guessed at this by assigning 4 points for allowing 6 points and 4 points for allowing between 100-199 yards - this might not be correct, but it's only a point or two off if so.

In addition, I will update this if there are any other major performances tonight or Monday night.

"Just a reminder that when Jamal Williams is healthy, he will still be splitting time with Aaron Jones","I think a lot of people are gonna view today’s game as evidence that Jones has now “broken out”, and that he’ll be the feature back from here on out. And to some extent, I think you’re right; I do think this will have made the argument that he has sealed up the goal line back position and will he involved more as a pass catcher. However, he’s a 5’ 9” back that they desperately want to keep healthy, and there’s a limit to how many touches they will give him. However, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing: as long as he gets high value touches, and stays healthy, I think we should get a good return from a third round pick. Just don’t go crazy thinking all of a sudden he’s gonna be like the new GB workhorse, but it’s not gonna be an Eagles or SF situation either.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I’m a Jones owner myself. I think he’ll still be a high end RB2 going forward, I’m just saying don’t get frustrated if he’s still splitting time. He’s proving with this game he can be productive even while splitting time, which was part of my point.",74,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/debaa0/just_a_reminder_that_when_jamal_williams_is/,6916.241992549101,r/fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Consider stacking the Bills and Panthers DSTs,"Stacking defenses is a bit controversial. Nobody wants to carry two defenses. But stacking the Panthers and the Bills D could be an easy way to have safe floor and high upside defenses in your lineup for the whole season. Both are strong defenses that have proved they can smack around bad teams. If the stack works right, you only have to play them against average to bad teams for the rest of the season. And with the Bills' bye in week 6, and the Panthers in week 7, now might be the easiest time to pick them up.

If you don't want to read the whole post, here's a small summary: two games against Miami, two games against Washington, and a lot of high upside potential games for above average defenses.

Let's take a look at the possible schedule for this stack, starting with week 6:

Week 6: Panthers vs. Bucs: The Bucs have allowed the 6th most points to fantasy defenses, thanks to sub par offensive line play. Combined with the Panthers surprisingly strong pass rush, there's high chance for multiple sacks. 

Week 7: Buffalo vs. Miami: Duh

Week 8: Panthers vs. Titans: The Titans have been surprisingly careful with the ball this season, but the offensive line, like Tampa, is porous. They've allowed over three sacks a game so far, and Mariota's ball control can't last forever.

Week 9: Bills vs. Redskins: Duh

Week 10: Bills @ Browns: Mayfield and the Browns have given up the 9th most points on average to defenses this year. It's possible the Bills put up a stinker like the Ravens did against the Browns, but with a young quarterback and a defense that held Tom Brady and the Super Pats in check, I feel confident.

Week 11: Bills @ Miami: Duh

Week 12: Bills vs. Denver/Panthers @ Saints: I'm leaving both here in case Brees isn't back yet, but the Bills vs. Denver is a more promising scenario. Flacco and the Denver offense is pretty average right now. Not a super exciting play, but should be a safe one with the Bills talent. 

NOTE: At this point in the stack, it would be safe to drop the Bills. There next matchups are tough, and Carolina can take it.

Week 13: Panthers vs. Washington: Duh (note that this is the 4th game for the stack against Miami/Washington in 8 games...)

Week 14: Panthers @ Falcons: The Falcons offense played well this week, but it's still one of the worse offenses in the league, and Atlanta has been playing poorly all season. At this point, if there's a better matchup on waivers, you can dump Carolina, but this is a great matchup to have rolling in the last weekend.

Stacking DSTs obviously isn't for everyone, but I think this stack could really give you the small boost you need to win your league, make the playoffs, or even stave off a last place punishment.

TL;DR: Carolina and Buffalo play Washington and Miami 4 times in 8 weeks, plus some other desirable matchups. Roster both if you have the space and don't have the Pats.",25,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dea028/consider_stacking_the_bills_and_panthers_dsts/,7017.958659549554,r/fantasyfootball

EDIT: Clarify, read the 50%. This isn't complaining about the guy who's my top scorer in just two quarters.

Deandre Hopkins is no longer the target monster he was because the Texans finally have healthy receivers. You need to adjust your expectations.,"Hopkins has been a target monster his entire career, largely because the Texans QBs have been absolute trash until Deshaun. 

Last year, Deshaun's first full season, Hopkins remained a target hog because Fuller and Keke were both injured for the majority of the season. Our tight ends had not emerged as pass-catchers. Our WR corps was so thin, we were literally lining up backup running backs as wide receivers for plays. 

This season, Fuller seems to finally be healthy, Stills was acquired, Keke is healthy (for now), we are utilizing our Tight Ends as pass-catchers, and we traded for Duke Johnson, who will absorb some targets. Hopkins is not going to command anywhere near the target share he once did and, when teams are double-teaming him or pulling safeties to help cover him, Deshaun has no reason to risk the interception because we have other receivers.

Nuk will have his games, but you need to adjust your expectations on a week to week basis and I highly recommend selling high on him when he eventually blows up for a game.

**EDIT:** Edited because I'm second guessing myself on the name of someone I included.

**EDIT 2:** Some people are saying that there are no stats to back this up. Here are your stats. I will be including Nuk's numbers since 2015 because that is when he started producing at an elite level and that was the first year that Andre Johnson was not on the Texans.



Year | Tgt/G | Rec/G | Y/Tgt | Y/Rec
----|-----|-----|-----|-----
2015 | 12 | 6.9 | 7.92 | 13.70
2016 | 9.4 | 4.9 | 9.4 | 12.23
2017 | 11.6 | 6.4 | 7.92 | 14.35
2018 | 10.2 | 7.2 | 9.64 | 13.67
2019 | 9 | 6 | 7.19 | 10.79

Keep in mind the data you're looking at does not include today's game because PFR doesn't have today's game up yet. Also keep in mind 2016 was the atrocious year with Brock Osweiler. 

Nuk has averaged fewer targets per game this season than with Brock - who was infamous for *not* throwing to Nuk enough. Obviously the quality of the targets that Hopkins is receiving are is higher than that of those in 2016, but his yardage per target is also way, way down from the norm. So if Nuk is not getting as many targets, and Nuk is not getting downfield targets, and Nuk is not getting red zone targets, that's a recipe for massive regression. Hopkins's single outlier this year was Week 1, where he received 13 targets for 8 receptions and 111 yards for 2 TDs. Since then he's been 5/8 for 40 yards, 6/7 for 67, and 5/8 for 4 - an average of 7.7 targets per game - I think he was 8/9 today so that will go up, but still trailing the norm by quite a lot.

Also keep in mind, I could be wrong. This is my opinion and Hopkins *has* had stretches of games in the past where his target share has dipped, although there are only two such stretches of 3 games in a row where his target dipped below double-digits outside of the Osweiler year. If I'm right and today's game was a 9 target day, then **this is the first time since 2014 *including* Osweiler's trash season where Nuk has been limited to single-digit targets 4 games in a row.**",261,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de951y/deandre_hopkins_is_no_longer_the_target_monster/,7081.9753263831135,r/fantasyfootball

"If we keep playing Stefon, are we Diggsing our own grave?","3 Targets. 2 Rec. 24 yards.

I know Run first offense, but this is a huge problem. He has 22 targets in almost 5 games. Thats 4.4 targets. Last year he had 149. Almost 9.3 a game.

What are we doing with Stefon? Not good enough to start. Not bad enough to drop. Will have a 20 pt game on bench.",43,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de83m1/if_we_keep_playing_stefon_are_we_diggsing_our_own/,7155.741993347804,r/fantasyfootball

Bills D/ST,"I was pretty sure that Santos’s field goal was blocked by the Bills, but there are no points for it on ESPN. Did he just miss or was there a scoring error?

Edit: Score has been updated on ESPN. Got credit for the block",6,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de80cl/bills_dst/,7162.458660050233,r/fantasyfootball
ESPN and kicker scoring errors,"Remember last week when Zuerlein had a stat correction with a 4 point swing because of the penalty that wiped out a field goal?

We are looking at the same thing with Joey Slye. He still has the 5 points for a field goal from early in the game, so right now in ESPN standard scoring, he is showing for 8 points when he only has 3. 

This is two weeks in a row with a pretty serious kicker stat correction. Come on, ESPN.",15,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de7yp7/espn_and_kicker_scoring_errors/,7165.975326732794,r/fantasyfootball

What more does DJ Chark have to do?,"Kinda calling out Boris Chen, that I use religiously, but may reconsider solely because of DJ Chark.

In my ESPN league, I picked him up to bolster myself after a shitty draft. He’s been a WR1 through five weeks now and he is STILL rated as Tier 8 wide receiver.

Like, what else is required to get this guy into like, at least Tier 4? He has like, top 15 WR points through four weeks. I’m seriously questioning what the methodology is if I can consistently count on this dude week after week?

Am I alone wondering this?",38,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de7hup/what_more_does_dj_chark_have_to_do/,7199.791993467013,r/fantasyfootball
Has anyone had incorrect trade dates from their Yahoo! Fantasy app?,"I had a trade scheduled to go through on the 8th of this month which traded 2 of my players for a receiver, but the trade went through two days early forcing one of my WR slots to be empty, and I couldn’t put the player I received from the trade in because by the time I realized his game had already started.

Josh Jacobs on the sidelines. Hurt his shoulder/arm.,"Watching the game. He seems in pain on sideline after tackled by Mack. Mack sort of landed on top of him and he hasn’t come back in since.

Edit: Phew! He’s back in to start second quarter

Edit 2: He ran off the field again, not moving his left arm. Wincing as he went to staff. Shaking his head. That didn’t look good.

Edit 3: Jacobs to locker room.

Edit 4: Jacobs back in!!! I can’t believe this rollercoaster.",26,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de6fo6/josh_jacobs_on_the_sidelines_hurt_his_shoulderarm/,7271.808660217126,r/fantasyfootball

Tarik Cohen with Chase Daniel as QB,"Last year Tarik had 2 games where Chase was the starting QB.

@ Detroit: 7 rec 8 tgts 45 yards 1 TD - 3 carries 14 yards - 18.9 ppr pts

@ NYG: 12 rec 14 tgts 156 yards - 8 carries 30 yards - 30.6 ppr pts

I think Tarik against Oakland could be a sneaky good start this week. Chase will lean on him.",39,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/de5tft/tarik_cohen_with_chase_daniel_as_qb/,7316.90866026481,r/fantasyfootball
