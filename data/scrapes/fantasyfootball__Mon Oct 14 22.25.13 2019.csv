"Keenan Allen owners. Besides any ironic commentary on his late season wardrobe changes, what makes you confident on him bouncing back to a WR1 status","I always see people on this sub talk to Keenan Allen’s previous late season success and dismiss any idea of him maintaining this low production.  With the Chargers offense looking like stale cornbread and the (not so)recent addition of other offensive threats to take targets, I don’t see any upside for the ROS.

Last year Allen started off very slow, but then put together a good 6 game stretch where he averaged around 15 points. But then dropped off the face of the earth for the last three games.  The season before that had a similar script. Although he had a much better front end of the season, he still dropped off mid season only to come back to 4 games averaging 19 points. But yet again was completely absent at the end of the season when we needed him in the playoffs.

Examining the Team: San Francisco 49ers,"Hello! In this series (where I hopefully go through each team), I want to review the season up to this point and review each of the offenses to see which fantasy players you should either A) hold, B) sell high, C) buy low and in what leagues they have value. I'll begin the San Francisco 49ers, my favorite team and the one I know the best.


**Disclaimer: I'm offering suggestions, but the main point of this post is to open up discussion.**


**QB: Jimmy Garappolo**

Everyone's favorite pornstar-banging QB, there have been major concerns about Jimmy G's productivity. Through Week 6, he's thrown 113 passes for 921 yards (230.2 y/g) and 7 TDs. The common consensus is that he's played perfectly average and been able to succeed thanks to his supporting cast. There's certainly some truth to those views. Take the 49ers' victory over the Steelers: Jimmy G threw some awful interceptions that could have been exploited for points by better offenses (sorry Mason Rudolph). And even in the Rams win, he had a brain-dead pick at the goal-line where threw it nowhere near the intended target. Also, considering that the 49ers are 31st in the league in pass plays per game (due to heavy ground game emphasis), Garappolo appears to be more of a game manager than a gunslinger.

However, I'd also like to make it clear that Jimmy G has been able to perform even with an inefficient run game. In the team's win over the Rams, the 49ers only had 99 rushing yards, with most coming in the 4th quarter when they were trying to burn through the clock. Instead, when Coleman and Breida were being bottled up early, Shanahan relied on Garappolo to throw short-yardage passes to convert third-downs and move the ball down the field. If anything the interception in the red-zone was the anomaly of the afternoon, as the QB was able to spread the ball effectively across the field.

**Conclusion:** Even with the positives, due to the low volume and TD opportunity, Jimmy G is at best a bye-week fill-in. He'll have some nice games in the future with the Redskins next week and the Cardinals down the line for streamer fantasy owners; unfortunately, the priority will always be establishing the run game over. **Hold** if you have him because you're only holding on to him for depth, or as an option in 2-QB formats. There's zero trade value to be had. However, Jimmy G is extremely important for...

&nbsp;

**WRs: Dante Pettis, Marquise Goodwin, Kendrick Bourne, Richie James, Jr., Deebo Samuel**

Look, I know how little value the 49ers place on their WRs. If anything, they are used to either A) stretch the field, B) pre-snap motion to confuse defenses or C) short-yardage pickups. There's a reason to hope, though. While James and Bourne have little fantasy value in any league and Goodwin only has value in the lens that Travis Benjamin has value in LA (deep-league flier that explodes every one or two games), Pettis and Samuel should be on your benches in 12-team formats.


Samuel's the easier of the two receivers to dissect. Even though he had a bit of an injury scare in the Rams game, through the season, Samuel has had the highest snap count out of all the WRs. This isn't likely to change because Samuel's build makes him a perfect blocker for screen passes and a solid target in the red-zone. In games that are close throughout (barring one, most games this season have been blowouts), Deebo Samuel will have relied on more and more. Think of him as the safest option here (albeit, not a sexy one).


I want to talk up Dante Pettis, however. While the sophomore wideout clearly was not trusted throughout the season for his training camp failures, through the last few games, his usage has skyrocketed. On Sunday, he had the most targets in the game out of the WRs (six), and from what I'm seeing, he has A) the most separation out of everyone, including TE George Kittle (1.83 y/c vs. 1.5 y/c) and B) has clearly regained Shanahan's trust. I'd never say you should buy into a 3 for 45 yard-line, but honestly, if you need bench depth, Pettis is a decent option. He, at the moment, appears to be back on track as the team's WR1.


Trent Taylor and Jalen Hurd will be returning soon, though. While Hurd is a WR/TE hybrid that should be used in schemes akin to Juice (as a blocker with receiving potential), Taylor should slide into the starting slot position. He had the training camp of his life this offseason and could command a solid target share, but this more hypothetical and he shouldn't be on any rosters.


**Conclusion:** There are no great options here, to be honest. Pettis has the ""star-potential"" but he's been wildly inconsistent in snap count share. Samuel is the best performing receiver, but could easily turn in dud performances any week. **Hold** Pettis and Samuel, if you have them: their trade value is non-existent, but until the 49ers are truly tested, we don't know which WR will be relied on (if George Kittle doesn't just hog everything).

&nbsp;

**RBs: Matt Breida, Tevin Coleman, Raheem Mostert, Jeff Wilson, Jr.**

The bread and butter of the 49ers offense has and always will be their ground game. Regardless of the team they face, Shanahan will rely heavily on the 49ers run game to either tire the defense or pick up chunk yardage. There's certainly a reason why: Coleman and Breida are both effective RBs. But who's got command of the backfield.

From what I've watched, Coleman is definitely the more heavily used back. Thanks to his pass-blocking, he'll see third-down usage and see the more prominent usage in the passing game (he dropped a would-be TD pass that was a bit off target on Sunday). However, the more explosive and efficient runner is Matt Breida. If you told me that one of the RBs had busted off a 20+ yard carry and asked me to guess who it was, I'd say Matt Breida 10/10 times. Breida is less effective in short-yardage situations and in the red-zone, so his TD potential is low, but due to how often the 49ers run the ball, there's certainly value to be had.

However, I do want to raise some red flags, though. While it's easy to jump on the Booger McFarland hate train, the 49ers did struggle to establish the run game on Sunday afternoon, mainly due to the absence of key blocking weapons (McGlinchey, Staley, Juice). This isn't a death knell for the running game (Shanahan's scheme and play design are otherworldly), but that isn't to say that fantasy owners should sit idly either or remain unconcerned. The 49ers are solid in pass protection but were unable to create holes for the ground game, and with games against Carolina, Seahawks, Bears, and Vikings on the horizon, it's fair to say that there may be weeks where the 49er RBs bust.

Oh and Raheem Mostert has no fantasy value, by the way, unless either RB ahead of him gets injured. He's the garbage time back who's on the roster for special teams work. However, if Breida or Coleman fall, Mostert should be a high priority add.

**Conclusion:** This may be a hot take, but I believe there's room to be concerned about the rushing attack. They'll get their volume, but without key blocking pieces and as teams slowly adjust to the scheme and sell out to stop the run game, I'm concerned the production won't be there or will be split. This isn't a reaction to one game, I want to be clear, but I think you'll be able to extract more value in a trade than you might get later down the season. **Sell high on Breida and Coleman,** as both are low-end RB2s that can be packaged for a higher-tier RB, like Mack, Freeman, or Montgomery.

&nbsp;

**TE: George Kittle, Levine Toilolo, Ross Dwelley**

George Kittle is good at football. He can catch, block, run routes, stretch the field, and heck he might be able to throw the ball for all I know. If you have him, it's unlikely you have better options right now, so you're probably holding him. However, the only reason I mention his two teammates Toilolo and Dwelley is that both saw above 30 snaps on Sunday. Why? Because while most people were concerned that Kittle's role in the passing game would reduce with him having to take over more blocking duties, instead Shanahan as turned to two TE sets where either Toilolo or Dwelley become the main blocker, effectively a bandage solution while Juice is out. Obviously, neither is good as the Pro-Bowl FB, but it's definitely a good sign for Kittle's volume and consistency.

**Conclusion:** Kittle's consistency will remain. He should be held unless you get a mindblowing offer, but as TE is starting to head into the wasteland territory with injuries, you're probably not selling.

&nbsp;

**K: Robbie Gould** 

Anyone freaking out about Robbie Gould should relax. The main long snapper will be returning from his suspension soon and this is the first time the P Mitch Winsoky has ever been a holder. They'll build chemistry over time and Gould will remain a top kicking option due to the amount of offense the 49ers should be able to generate + the good field position the team starts with thanks to their defense.

&nbsp;

**DST**

The Saleh-led defense is for real. Not only are they able to generate consistent pressure on the QB, just rushing 4 (behind only the Patriots), their secondary has actually been impressive (which is extremely surprising as a 49ers fan as we haven't made many changes from last year there). Besides the Patriots and maybe the Bills, they are a DST you should hold, regardless of matchup, thanks to the sacks + turnovers they will generate.",25,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di06km/examining_the_team_san_francisco_49ers/,268.0669645031293,r/fantasyfootball

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

Statistically (in)Significant: Week 6,"Welcome to Statistically (in)Significant, the place to find great stats that probably only matter at the water cooler (or bar). Each week I'll dig through the stats of the week gone by and deliver you some choice conversation starters. All fantasy stats are standard Yahoo scoring, unless otherwise noted.

&nbsp;

**5 TE’s at the Top**

&nbsp;

Through Sunday in Week 6, the tight end spot in fantasy has been quite a slog. There’s been no dominant player at the position, though there have been a few pleasant surprises. Going into this week, there were 5 players between 49 and 51 points on the season. Unfortunately, it looks like **Will Dissly**, who led the pack by a very slim margin, could be done for the season with an Achilles tear. That leaves us with the newest break-out TE **Austin Hooper** as our leader. Hooper took advantage of a Cardinals defense that is giving up an absurd amount points to opposing TEs. Hooper has now finished as a top 3 TE in 3 of 6 weeks so far this season. Rounding out the top 5 are the always reliable **Travis Kelce, Evan Engram** (who missed a game, so his per-game average is still pretty good), and finally the Ravens break-out star, **Mark Andrews**. 

&nbsp;

**78 Passing Yards**

&nbsp;

**Jared Goff** had a whopping 78 passing yards on Sunday, a career low for him, which roughly equates to $20,833 per yard gained through the air this week. The Rams had a particularly bad game against the still undefeated 49ers. They scored a TD on their opening drive and then did nothing for the rest of the game. The fact that they gained all their yards on the ground that first drive seems like a bad omen for the way the rest of the game went for them. It’s hard to tell where this team’s fantasy potential is headed. On one hand, this offense was a juggernaut last season and now have scored at least 27 points in 4 of 6 games this season. On the other hand, you have **Jared Goff**, who has thrown more picks than touchdowns in the last 4 weeks. Aside from this week, the Rams are still putting up decent fantasy points with their big players, so I wouldn’t ditch them all yet, but I would consider who I start against the 49ers going forward.

&nbsp;

**116 Passing Yards in One Drive**

&nbsp;

The Chiefs haven’t done a lot of winning the last couple weeks, but **Patrick Mahomes** is still doing amazing things on the field. In their first drive, thanks to several penalties, Mahomes managed the stunning mathematical trick of throwing for 116 yards in one drive. Unfortunately for the Chiefs, they only gained another 157 yards through the air the remainder of the game. They only had about 20 minutes in time of possession for the entire game, and clearly this has become the (rather obvious) method for defeating the Chiefs. Last week, they had just under 23 minutes in time of possession. Against the Texans, the Chiefs only ran the ball 11 times despite never being down more than 7 points in the game. On the other side, the Texans ran the ball 41 times to go along with 42 passing attempts. Balance, my friends, is key in all things.

&nbsp;

**27 D/ST Fantasy Points**

&nbsp;

With another 27 fantasy points this week, the **New England Patriots D/ST** squad has just dominated fantasy football. Their 27 points made them the 8th highest scoring “player” in Week 6. On the season, the defense and special teams have combined for 5 TDs and have 16 turnovers in just 6 games. They’re second in the league with 25 sacks and have given up only 3 touchdowns on defense all season. Their 127 fantasy points on the season make them the 9th highest scoring entity in fantasy football this season, behind only one non-QB, **Christian McCaffrey**. Compared to other D/STs, they are 52 points ahead of the second highest scoring team and have more than doubled up the 4th highest scoring team.

&nbsp;

**36.5 Fantasy Points in Week 6**

&nbsp;

The squeaky wheel does often get the grease, though sometimes it takes a few weeks to apply it. This week, **Stefon Diggs** had a monster game, scoring 3 TDs and 167 yards on 7 receptions, adding 18 rushing yards on 2 carries just for fun. This more than doubles his season total in points – he had just 27.3 through 5 games going into Week 6. Since the Vikings rough defeat in Chicago Week 4, they have put up 66 points in just two games. During that time, **Kirk Cousins** has 2 300+ yard games to go along with 6 TDs and just one pick. It turns out that the Vikings can’t just run the ball all game, like they did early in the season. They need to pass it as well, thus giving their offense balance. Déjà vu, no?

49ers DST FAAB spend question?,"49ers DST is currently only owned in 64% of Yahoo leagues and 53% of ESPN leagues.

Mason Rudolph May be a QB to roster after his bye.,"Now that may seem crazy to think for a new QB on an ok Pit team. But going forward he does have some favorable matchups and his defense will keep them in games. In the 6 weeks after their bye this week he has the following matchups: Mia, Indy, LAR, CIN and CLE twice. 

Sure Indy maybe one of those grind it out games where it flys by but he can still post a decent number. Now here’s where this could be interesting, the Steelers are two games out of the division and still well within the wildcard(yeah it’s early still). But the defense can keep it close and Rudolph is building more chemistry with the Offense. I believe if the ravens lose this week PIT may go out and get an offensive player before the trade deadline. It’s all speculation but I think Rudolph can be very interesting going forward.",19,0.35,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhww8d/mason_rudolph_may_be_a_qb_to_roster_after_his_bye/,512.5502985358238,r/fantasyfootball
Anyone else losing confidence in Travis Kelce?,"Before anyone says “shut up ur lucky u have him”, u gotta realize the draft capital it took to get him.

Anyways, does anyone else feel like Kelce is trending down as the top fantasy TE this year? There’s something different about the KC offense this season bc he’s not getting any TDs and his targets are lower than expected. His floor has been fine but we haven’t really had any blow up games yet, which is concerning. I feel like his usage is at an all time low, with only 8 catches over the last 2 weeks. We know what he’s capable of, as he proved week 2 and in previous seasons, but his production seems a bit lackluster when u take his ADP into consideration. As someone who is supposed to be a target hog and score a lot of TDs, I really don’t think he’s living up to his draft position thus far when there have been multiple stud TEs coming off the waivers.",73,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhwr5z/anyone_else_losing_confidence_in_travis_kelce/,522.100298567613,r/fantasyfootball

Let's say you are up by 1 point (or some low amount) and your last player is on MNF. Do you just bench them to avoid negative points?

"FIRE UP THOSE, UH -- NEW YORK GIANTS???","One of the keys to winning fantasy football is to realize how quickly things change in the NFL. Right now the Chiefs, Rams, and Cowboys look somewhat broken. Would anyone have suggested that a few weeks ago?

I just have this inkling that people may be overlooking the Giants as a potential source of fantasy gold going forward. Of course the general consensus is that the G-men are mostly crap, outside of Barkley. But consider this:

Daniel Jones has seemed to breath new life into the Giants, but they just came off the worst team to play, and haven't had everyone healthy at the same time all year.

Now, or in just a few weeks, they're going to have Jones, Barkley, Shephard, Tate, Engram, and the quietly emerging Darius Slayton as offensive pieces to pair with a mediocre at best defense that may lead to shootouts. I think this team will be a somewhat surprising source of points in the 2nd half of the season.

Chase Edmonds vs David Johnson,"After watching yesterday’s game, does anyone else think Chase Edmonds just looks like a more explosive running back than DJ these days? I owned DJ last year during the horrible McCoy days, and I thought Edmonds generally looked better then too. Obviously DJ is still producing and is a great pass catching back with good vision, but in terms of hitting the hole, evading/breaking tackles, and lateral movement/speed, Edmonds has just looked better to me. 

This isn’t suggesting that Edmonds should take the starting job or anything, but I’m just wondering if I’m crazy in thinking that he’s looked better. In the first half yesterday, it seemed like they were splitting the backfield pretty evenly, but they leaned more heavily on DJ after the half. Personally, I’d like to see Edmonds handle some more work and see how he does.

Any Le'Veon Bell owners worried about his fantasy performance now that Darnold is back?,"When Darnold was out, Bell was practically (if not literally) the leading receiver on the team in terms of targets. Falk did plenty of check down passes and screens as Bell was his comfort blanket/quilt.

But did anyone see how many targets he got against the Cowboys? Just 1. Now this is mainly more an issue for PPR leagues but Darnold being back means there's a bittersweet and/or double edged sword feeling for Bell.

The positives is now Defenses can't key in on Bell anymore or else Darnold can use his other weapons (R. Anderson, J. Crowder, D. Thomas). Thus we'll probably see an uptick in his run game regardless of the O-Line issues. And because the offense can now move through the air, I see Bell getting plenty of dives into the endzone.

The negatives, again in PPR, means this will be a significant downgrade in recent performances. Less reliance on Bell in the passing game because now the Jets have their QB back, and he's not afraid to throw it deep.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

It looks like with Tannehill under center, they are going to be throwing a bit more. Target volume for all three receivers almost doubled compared to when Mariota is throwing the ball this past week. I'm looking at Humphries in particular as the underneath slot guy in a PPR league. He was pretty decent when he was on the Bucs and if Tannehill continues to start, I think he can end up being a consistent WR 4, borderline 3. Corey Davis has the biggest boom/bust potential though imo with AJ brown in that conversation.

Maybe i'm reading too much into this and should stay clear of the dumpster fire that is the Titans but I tend to try and look where others aren't.",41,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhsce0/titans_receivers_with_tannehill/,822.8502995848655,r/fantasyfootball

If you have someone playing tonight or on bye. Consider dropping them for the bills dst or Josh Allen,"As far as I know this only works if you’re league utilizes free agency. 

The bills are playing Miami next week, so this could be a good time to get ahead of your waivers. Luckily for me, my opponent has no more players to play and I only had the GB dst remaining. I typically stream QB so I dropped the dst for Josh Allen.

Take a look at who’s available from any of the teams that haven’t played, maybe they’re worth an pre-waiver add. Maybe you’re going to be targeting them during waivers. This gives you a guarantee that you’ll get them and you might still be able to get another player during waivers.

Texans TEs? A discussion,"Looks like, with Hopkins struggling (ailing?) this year, Watson has been spreading the ball around more, including to his TEs.  Currently Jordan Akins and Darren Fells are in an almost 50/50 split; Akins is a more athletic rookie, while Fells is a career journeyman.  However, Fells also has the edge in production as of late.  

Texans have some great TE matchups coming up so I think they’re names worth considering if you’ve been hit by injury (IE with Dissly).  Either has TE1 potential if the other goes down, but injury’s not really something you’d want to bet on.  Which of the two would you prefer RoS?  Can both be startable at the same time?

Kyler owners - what are you doing weeks 9-12,"Kyler's been killing it for me so far. However, weeks 9-12 he has the following schedule:

* Week 9: Home for San Francisco

* Week 10: @ Tampa Bay

* Week 11: @ San Francisco

* Week 12: Bye

Obviously @TB is a very playable matchup. However, given what we've seen out of Goff and Baker the last two weeks I'd strongly prefer to avoid playing him against SF.  That means 3/4 weeks I'm going to need to find another QB. So what's everyone else thinking for this 4 game stretch?

Is Zac Taylor really the offensive genius we thought he was?,"Let's take a deep look at Zac Taylor's coaching timeline:

* After flaming out of the NFL and CFL, Taylor was looking for work
* He **began his coaching career under his father-in-law Mike Sherman** at Texas A&M in 2008
   * In his time from 2008-2011, Sherman served as a a Graduate Assistant and Tight Ends coach
* Mike Sherman was fired from Texas A&M in 2011 but was hired as the Offensive Coordinator for the Miami Dolphins for the 2012 season 
   * It seems a bit weird that Mike Sherman was hired as an OC when he was fired from a college team after a super disappointing 4 years at A&M. Let's see how that happened:
      * Philbin is named head coach
      * Philbin hired Sherman to be his OC
      * Previously, Sherman gave Philbin his first job in the NFL when Sherman was the Head Coach/GM of the Packers - So it seems that Philbin was returning the favor
      * Sherman was happy to have his son-in-law tag along 
      * *Yes, Nepotism is a common theme here*
* Obviously, Taylor was now in need of work so again he followed his father-in-law and join the Miami Dolphins as an Assistant QB Coach
   * Taylor was promoted to QB Coach in 2013 
* Mike Sherman left the Dolphins to coach high school football in 2014 and Bill Lazor was hired
* In 2015, Bill Lazor is fired and our boy Zac Taylor is named Interim Offensive Coordinator
   * **As OC, points decrease 17%, yards decrease 8%, and touchdowns decrease 24%**
   * Yes, this is the same Bill Lazor that Zac Taylor replaced in Cincinnati  (Lazor was the playcaller when he was fired)
   * **Taylor's success in Miami was ""developing Ryan Tannehill""** (developing him to what?)
*  Dolphins decided to part ways with Taylor and Taylor was hired as OC for Cincinnati after Jim Turner put in a good word to Tommy Tuberville (Cincinnati's head coach)
   * **In his 1 season at Cincinnati, Taylor's offense failed to score a TD in 3 games**
   * **His team went 4-8**
* Taylor was hired as assistant QB coach in 2017 and promoted to QB coach in 2018
   * Taylor studied under McVay but never was the playcaller
* In 2019 he was named Head Coach of the Bengals 
   * **Bengals are 0-6**
   * **Rank 29th in points per game**
   * **Rank 32nd in rushing yards per game**

There's a long history of a lack of success in Taylor's coaching past. Let's see some excuses we can make for Taylor to make us feel better:

* He inherited Marvin Lewis's team
* He doesn't have AJ Green
* His offensive line sucks

While these may be valid, I'm staying away from his offense this year and I'm definitely not drafting any Bengals next year.",132,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhqrh8/is_zac_taylor_really_the_offensive_genius_we/,940.3502998987834,r/fantasyfootball

Charting your own league,"Hey FF fam,

I started to create basic charts for our league showing total points scored, and points against.

Basically it's just for checking who actually performs well or who is getting crushed by bad fortune.

It has lead to some seriously funny smack talk so I wanted to think of some other charts that would be interesting.

One idea would be the 'golden hand': counting the points left on the bench vs. the ones in the starting lineup. The issue with this is that I can't find them accumulated somewhere (platform is ESPN).

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

"Cowboys WR Amari Cooper was diagnosed yesterday with a thigh bruise, source said, which can be horribly painful and knocked him out of the loss to the #Jets. At the least, though, there is no indication of long-term damage.",,81,0.99,https://twitter.com/rapsheet/status/1183698998282145792?s=21,1104.3836335817973,r/fantasyfootball
The Case for the Steelers D/ST,"Right now the Pittsburgh Steelers defence is 27% owned in Yahoo leagues, a criminally low number imo.

I know after our 0-3 start everyone was ready to write us off. But, with the acquisition of Minkah (and Bush), our defence has been TRANSFORMED. Here are some pretty significant defensive stats on our season before and after Minkah.

*Before Minkah:*

* 30.5 PPG
* 445 YPG
* 320 Pass YPG
* 2 Takeaways

*After Minkah:*

* 17.7 PPG
* 296 YPG
* 169.7 Pass YPG
* 10 Takeaways

&#x200B;

Our defence does not only revolve around Minkah. We have **10** first-round draft picks playing on our defence at the moment, some Pro Bowl and All-Pro worthy. Here are some more critical stats about our D this season:

* **3rd** in Sacks (behind only CAR & NE)
* **3rd** in INTs (behind again NE & CAR)

These turnovers mean our defence still puts up pretty decent scores even when teams score highly against us:

* Week 2 (vs SEA: 28 points) - 7 fantasy points
* Week 3 (@ SF: 24 points) - 11 fantasy points
* Week 5 (vs BAL: 26 points) - 11 fantasy points
* Week 6 (@ LAC: 17 points) - 14 fantasy points

&#x200B;

Our schedule is ridiculously nice from Week 8 onwards with a few tough fixtures sprinkled in. I am planning on rotating the Bills D with the Steelers until Week 12 from which I will set-and-forget this Steelers D.

* Week 8 - Miami
* Week 9 - Indianapolis (Bills play Washington)
* Week 10 - LAR (Bills play Cleveland)
* Week 11 - Cleveland (Bills play Miami)
* Week 12 - Cincinnati
* Week 13 - Cleveland
* Week 14 - Arizona
* Week 15 - Buffalo
* Week 16 - New York Jets

&#x200B;

I know this may seem crazy to some but come Week 16, I believe we will still be in playoff contention and fighting as hard as possible. Our losses (bar the Patriots) have been a 2 point loss, a last-minute TD to lose, and an overtime loss. Our record does not reflect our team and with the schedule we have coming up, and with the weaker division we are in, I truly believe we will be playing for something come the end of the season.

&#x200B;

One concern I have had is the struggles of our offence. Our offensive struggles meant that our defence was on the field for most of the game. However, with Mason Rudolph coming back, James Conner looking good, and our offensive line being one of the best in the league, I hope things will be changing. Especially with that schedule, I don't see our offensive struggles continuing much further.",42,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhoc4u/the_case_for_the_steelers_dst/,1175.9836336016656,r/fantasyfootball
How we feeling with Melvin Gordon?,"Obviously two games is a tiny sample size, but since I only got 55 points this week I've decided to press the panic button. And since he doesn't have the easiest schedule from now on, what's the game plan? Is he a ride or die or is it good to sell?",78,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dho9h0/how_we_feeling_with_melvin_gordon/,1184.9503002842268,r/fantasyfootball
Is Brandon Cooks droppable through Bye weeks?,"Rams have looked poor recently and Cooks seems to be 3rd in line behind Kupp and Woods. O-Line aren’t giving Goff time to go deep, so targets aren’t there.

Are these temporary O-Line issues or likely season long? Right now I’m more likely to drop him to get me through bye weeks than Fitz/Alshon.

Edit: I understand the responses saying this is kneejerk and I normally wouldn’t consider. I have TE bye (Hooper) and QB bye (Baker) who I don’t want to drop, so I’m having to consider dropping someone I don’t want to. No one is interested in trading for Cooks and want to play to the situation not the name, hence questioning whether this O-Line is significantly worse than previous years. Cooks isn’t getting the targets he previously has.

Edit edit: 12 team 2 QB league, hence value of QB with the Duck and Rosen the best of the rest available.",44,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhngpw/is_brandon_cooks_droppable_through_bye_weeks/,1283.6836336334547,r/fantasyfootball

The Story Behind Hopkins,"After Hopkins started the off the season opener against the Saints on MNF, people who drafted Hopkins in the first rounds creamed their pants myself included based on his performance. As the weeks went on Hopkins didn't perform up to par based on his draft ADP sending his owners in a frenzy. Let's break down the timeline of Hopkins, starting from last season.

Hopkins tore his shoulder ligament ""completely off the bones"" during the 2018 playoffs. 

Source: [https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/1783583](https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/1783583)

Then coming into this year he sustained a rib injury after game 1.

Source: [https://www.rotoballer.com/player-news/deandre-hopkins-limited-with-ribs-injury/669449](https://www.rotoballer.com/player-news/deandre-hopkins-limited-with-ribs-injury/669449)

Up to this point Hopkins was already working  his way back to 100 percent for the start of the season, and suffering  a rib injury in Week 2 threw a wrench to the beginning of his season.

Despite his injury early this season, he still hasn’t missed a game and has 31 receptions, 347 receiving yards, and a pair of touchdown catches through five games. His production isn’t actually poor, but it is a slight regression from Hopkins’ production in 2018. Hopkins started last season with 39 receptions, 594 receiving yards, and two touchdown receptions in the first five games in 2018.

I believe that a combination of playing banged up and defensive game plans tailored to contain Hopkins are playing a role in his lack of production. However, with the improved personnel on offense, the defenses will have to be honest and won’t only be game-planning to stop Hopkins as the season progresses.",61,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhlkoq/the_story_behind_hopkins/,1493.733633784453,r/fantasyfootball

Boyd is tough to get rid of just from a target standpoint. Had 10 today even. Didn't grab enough but that's bound to happen with a 0-5 offense.

Thoughts on Denver DST,"Saw they put up a respectable stat line against the Chargers week 5, and they absolutely killed it today. Any Denver fans (or anyone who caught the games) can explain what’s going on with this Defense?",29,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhip7k/thoughts_on_denver_dst/,1759.2836341659229,r/fantasyfootball
Tevin Coleman moving forward,"It’s time to consider Tevin Coleman as a top 15 back. He’s is the primary ball carrier in Kyle Shanahan’s run offense, the 49ers game script will tend to favor Coleman’s play, and he is top red zone back. As the season progresses I also expect his involvement in the passing game to increase just like it did this weekend. Breida does get his touches but when Coleman first came back last week he had 16 touches and had 20 this week, in a Kyle Shanahan offense... I expect him to get on average 15-20 touches a week with a slight uptick in the number of catches he gets. That’s a pretty nice floor, even with the other RBs involved. Although I think his ceiling is lower than other top backs, his high floor makes him a steady week to week RB2 and fringe RB1 when the matchup is juicy.",168,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhio2g/tevin_coleman_moving_forward/,1762.383634185791,r/fantasyfootball

Worth holding the 49ers rest of the season?,"I was skeptical at first holding the SF defense through the rest of the season since they didn’t play any high powered offenses but watching the game today, I became more confident in rolling with them although I’m still on the fence since they only played a better opponent once.

From what I’ve watched, they did a great job of shutting down Goff and the entire offense as well. They seem to be a good consistent source of sacks and although the INT’s might be lacking, they apply great pressure to the offense. 

Their bye week is done but they play some tougher opponents like GB, Seattle (twice), and NO when Brees is set to return. Would they still be worth rostering if you want to roll with a defense for the rest of the season?",94,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhimnl/worth_holding_the_49ers_rest_of_the_season/,1766.2836342175801,r/fantasyfootball

"Consider again starting Kirk Cousins Weeks 7, 8 and 9","Kirk Cousins is guranteed to finish no lower than 9th in total points during the last two weeks. As of now the only QBs to score more in weeks 5 and 6 are DeShaun Watson, Matt Ryan, Kyler Murray and Russel Wilson. Aaron Rogers, Matt Stafford and Phillip Rivers could surpass him points but all would need good to great games.         
Cousins upcoming schedule is against Detroit, Washington and Kansas City. All three teams are allowing above average points to Qbs this year.     
Currently, he is owned in approximately 25% of all leagues. If your Qb is hurt and or on bye during weeks 7, 8 and 9 consider start Kirk Cousins.",63,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhii4h/consider_again_starting_kirk_cousins_weeks_7_8/,1777.7003009319305,r/fantasyfootball
Which players have a very safe floor but no upside past that?,"Who are guys in the league that don’t offer any upside outside like 6-8 points a week? Before this week Boyd seemed like a great safe floor player with not a huge upside.

Deedee Westbrook seems like a very consistent player with not a huge upside. Steady targets but unless he busts out for a touchdown he’ll get around 50-70 yards receiving.

Any other candidates who are consistent point getters but outside of a career day are gonna score 6-8 points?",164,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhighq/which_players_have_a_very_safe_floor_but_no/,1781.7669676144917,r/fantasyfootball

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

Would you roster Carolina’s DST through their bye?,"You’ve seen these posts before. The comments are: “It depends on your bench, your byes, etc.”

But, last 4 weeks:

13, 14, 14 and 21 points.

Bigger question: How healthy will they be after the bye and how good are they really? 

Are they sack machines or have they just played bad lines? 

They are currently 4th overall, but points separating the next tier isn’t a lot.

But if you count weeks 3-6, it’s been wild.",27,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhhdm9/would_you_roster_carolinas_dst_through_their_bye/,1875.0669678489367,r/fantasyfootball

Brandin Cooks coverage this week,"Cooks vs SF

Anyone know how Cooks CB matchup will likely look this week? Seems like a good week to bench him for dang near anyone with that niners front 7 pressuring goff. 

He’s not a dumpoff target and he’s not likely to get a ton of time to develop long routes. Hard to see more than 5 point in hppr without a TD. If he’s got a decent CB matchup he may be able to overcome this though..",40,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhcxt0/brandin_cooks_coverage_this_week/,2204.733635433515,r/fantasyfootball

Davante Parker?,"Yes we all know what a tanking disaster the Miami Dolphins are. however they happen to have an excellent matchup this week. Additionally if one looks at are yards both Preston Williams and DeVante Parker or among the NFL leaders. Of course they haven't done anywhere near enough with them.

Do you think this could be a sneaky start? He used to be considered a prototypical x receiver with speed and big size frame. Josh Rosen at quarterback perhaps offer some things that were not there with Fitzpatrick and there's a good chance that Albert Wilson is out this week.

Thoughts on DeVante Parker this week? Does he have any Flex appeal rest of season?",21,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhck3m/davante_parker/,2234.216968850295,r/fantasyfootball

"Top PPR RB/WR/TE once TDs are removed, sorted by PPG","Yesterday, u/AlanTheCow asked if there was any resource ranking players in PPR, without TDs. In response to that, I looked up the respective lists for the top RB, WR, and TE (which you can view [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgygp9/comment/f3gdbpu) ).

u/whosurcaddie then asked if it was possible to format the lists into PPG, so that is what I present to you here. A few notes though:

- All figures are taken from nfl.com fantasy
- All figures are accurate as of Saturday night, meaning TNF has been accounted for, but not the ongoing UK game
- Unless specified, every player has played 5 games
- Players currently injured ARE listed, but current free agents like AB are not
- RB and WR each have a 50 player list, whilst TE have a 20 player list, to reflect supply and demand

Heads up for Tyler boyd owners,Marlon Humphrey has been shadowing the opposing teams #1 wr this year. So Boyd isn’t necessarily safe just cause he plays mostly from the slot.

for tonight he might be worth a start? If you think about it, he is only one injury away to start at QB and get QB production in. 


And because the Steelers are injury-cursed at QB this season there is a way for him to get enough snaps to be relevant fantasy-wise. So if you are really tight at WR this weekend, why not take a small gamble.

Can SF D/ST duplicate last week's performance/ sack count ?,"SF D/ST completely hammered the browns , Nick bosa subsequently got DPOW and SF D/ST is kinda trending in terms of starting a good D/ST against the Rams tomorrow .But wondering if their performance last week is due to the fact that ugh, TE Demetrius Harris was tasked with blocking Bosa? Not sure if Harris blocks more than runs routes, but seems to me that this probably won't happen if a OL is protecting rather than Harris the TE.

Is Demarcus Robinson being overlooked this week?,"Pros:

1. With Watkins most likely out it looks like he would slide right into his role. 


2. He has had 90+% snaps for the last 4 weeks so he is on the field all the time on a high power offense. 

3. He has the 3rd highest targets only behind Sammy and Kelce. 


4. He has been with team for 3 years now and has a good understanding of the scheme and worked with Mahomes longer. 


5. He leads the KC WR with airyards, aDOT and was on the [week 5 airyards Leaders by Opportunity Delta](https://old.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dghwwd/buy_low_with_air_yards_week_5/). As a Curtis ""Airyard Champion"" Samuel owner I understand that airyards dont translate to fantasy points but the QB situation should be weighed in but in this case I feel good about Mahomes and them connecting more than any other QB throwing the ball. 


6. This going to be a very high scoring game with Vegas line set at 55. 

Cons:


1. The KC passing situation is truly unpredictable and anyone can be the flavor of the week. More murkiness is added if Tyreek Hill plays and it is trending that way. I still feel Demarcus Robinson will be out there for his usual 90+% snaps. 

2. KC O line is missing 2 offensive starters and texans have a good pass rush, so Mahomes will be pressured a lot this game. 



To wrap it up I am sure he there is some uncertainty but I still feel he is ranked too low for someone catching balls from Mahomes and most likely being part of a shootout.",50,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dh3mm9/is_demarcus_robinson_being_overlooked_this_week/,3154.9503034154573,r/fantasyfootball

Against the grain football fantasy opinions you had before the season and how they turned out.,"One of the best ways to get better at fantasy is to revisit past stances you had and critically evaluate them. Where and why were you right and vice verse for when you were wrong? I’ll start with 2 of my own I posted here. 

-Take:
Zeke’s holdout situation is pretty much as bad Melvin Gordon’s, so why is he going so much higher in drafts.

-Thread response 
Chargers are cheaper than the cowboys and zeke is more important to cowboys than Gordan is for the chargers.

-Result
Zeke signed an extension and played on week 1. Gordan did not sign an extension and first played week 5.

-My current take
So chat was right here and I was wrong. Most of my logic here came from the fact that I felt it was smarter for the cowboys not to sign zeke since zeke has next no leverage and pollard was likely be a good fill in. I still feel this is case (especially with what happened with Gordan, and because zeke isn’t even the focal point of Dallas’s offense anymore), but fantasy football is game about predicating what teams will do and not what everyone thinks they should do. In this case Zeke is a player that Dallas makes a lot of $$$ off of (sells jerseys and the tickets), and Jones isn’t exactly known for making the smartest decision. 

A current situation that kinda of mirrors is the Duke Johnson, Carlos Hyde backfield. Many people continue to start Johnson because they feel it makes more sense for Johnson to get more touches, but there’s been no indication that the team feels this way. 


-Take 
Russell Wilson is being drafted too low around the 10th, because while his efficiency may drop some from last year his volume should go up (Seattle won’t run the ball on 52% of snaps)

-Thread response 
Brian  schottenheimer and Pete Carroll call the plays now. Seattle will continue to be a run first offense and Russell’s efficiency will go down. He’s being drafted where he should.

-Result
Depending on site scoring Wilson is ranking from 2nd-4th in fantasy points among QB’s.  Seattle is passing the ball slightly more than 52% of the time. Wilson is running the ball himself at a much higher rate than in 2018

-My current take
I was right and wrong here. I knew there was a chance Wilson starts running the ball himself more this year, but it was something I was really banking on. Passing plays in general are up for Seattle, but not by a huge amount. Really I was most right when liking Wilson because he was good and not because he was going to get more volume this year.

The key thing to remember here is that unlike every other position, efficiency is more important for a QB than volume.  I and pretty much everyone else ob here where wrong in just assuming that Russ’s efficiency had to go down. Turns out he’s that good. 

Oh well I’ll just have to cry into the cash I’m likely to win from the all the different leagues I got him late in.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Don’t look now, but San Francisco is 4-0 for the first time since 1990 (ESPN). As an avid SF fan, I'd like to believe this team is for real, but the fact that they haven’t faced a team with a winning record can’t be ignored. The teams they’ve faced so far are a combined 5-15… The Rams are going to be their first legitimate test and the winner is in the driver's seat to win the NFC West. **Jimmy Garoppolo** hasn’t been spectacular from a fantasy standpoint and isn’t an option in 1QB leagues, but he’s been solid, posting the 14th best QBR. He really hasn’t been asked to do much as SF has ran away with most of their games. While rookie **Deebo Samuel** posted some good fantasy lines this season, there really is no clear No. 1 receiver for SF, 5 wideouts are consistently seeing snaps. At this point, all of the SF wideouts should be avoided due to the unpredictability of where volume will be going any given week. Samuel is at best an upside WR4/5. **Marquise Goodwin** is the second best bet to produce, while **Dante Pettis** belongs on the wire. **George Kittle** has graded out as the best player in the league (PFF) through 5 weeks and is an absolute stud. He did pick up a groin injury on Friday, and is now questionable for Sunday, so monitor his status before kickoff. Assuming health, he’s locked and loaded as a TE1 every week.    


**RB Breakdown**


The San Francisco running game seems to have narrowed down to the two man race originally pictured when the team signed **Tevin Coleman** in the offseason. **Matt Breida (upgrade PPR)** put up the big line last week, but Coleman saw the most carries in his return from injury. **Raheem Mostert** was involved as well, but only saw 7 carries in a game SF ran an eye-popping 40 times. **Jeff Wilson** was inactive last week, but could be used as the FB this week, replacing injured FB Klye Juszcczyk (Ninersnation). He’s not a fantasy option. Interestingly, LAR is ranked in the top-10 for Run DVOA, but is bottom-10 in FPPG to running backs at 21.5. The matchup is exploitable for the SF backs and both can be considered RB2 options in a game carrying the 3rd highest projected point total.   


**Rams**


**Opp (SF) Pass DVOA:** #1


**Opp (SF) Run DVOA:** #5


**Injuries to Watch DEF (SF):** CB Ahkello Witherspoon (OUT) DE Dee Ford (Q, on track to play)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (LAR):** Todd Gurley (Q) WR Brandin Cooks (Q)


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Cooper Kupp (28%) Robert Woods (21%) Brandin Cooks (15%) Gerald Everett (12%) Todd Gurley (10%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Todd Gurley (96%, 18, 5) Malcolm Brown (4%, 1, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


**Jared Goff’s (downgrade)** new contract is starting to become a hot topic around the NFL due to his poor play and the four-years and 134 million dollars remaining. It’s safe to wonder if he’s the long term answer or if the Rams shot themselves in the foot by getting ahead of themselves with the new contract. He’s currently the QB15 through 5 weeks, and a QB2 this week against possibly the best pass-rush in the NFL (11.3 FPPG to opposing quarterbacks). Probably the only bigger fantasy/real life disappointment this year is Baker Mayfield. **Brandin Cooks** has managed to pass through the concussion protocol well in advance of Sunday's game, so he joins **Cooper Kupp**, **Robert Woods** and **Gerald Everett** as Goff’s main targets. Kupp has continued a reign he started last year before tearing his ACL, and he needs to be considered a matchup proof WR1 moving forward, getting 9+ targets every week of the season. Woods is a solid WR2 and a threat to break a few big plays every week. Everett has put together impressive back-to-back weeks, and was putting up solid numbers even before Cooks went out last week. He’s a back-end TE1 against a defense only allowing 3.2 FPPG to tight ends. That number is extremely skewed due to the teams they’ve faced, but temper expectations with Everett. Cooks himself is a WR2/3 that may have a lower ceiling this year due to the O-Line issues, but consistently piles up targets and yardage every week. 


**RB Breakdown**


**Todd Gurley** is out Sunday with a quad injury, and if you saw our waiver article earlier in the week, it was highly recommended that Gurley owners scoop **Malcolm Brown** while they could. With Gurley likely out, Brown becomes a plug and play volume based RB2 in a tough matchup. The 49ers have only given up an amazing 9 FPPG to running backs so far. However, they really haven’t faced a competent offense yet. Rookie **Darrell Henderson (stash)** should be added but not started to see how things play out. There’s a chance his role could grow in the absence of Gurley, especially in the passing game - he caught 63 passes in 3 years at Memphis (Ramwire). If he sees meaningful minutes this week, he could be considered as a flex option next week in a smash spot for the Rams offense against ATL.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Devonta Freeman (53%, 16, 5) Ito Smith (47%, 11, 6)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Atlanta’s defense the last few years has been abysmal, in 2017 they finished 22nd in Football Outsiders’ DVOA efficiency measure. In 2018, they were 31st (SBnation). Dan Quinn was heralded as a defensive guru, but clearly something is very wrong with whatever the Falcons are doing on that side of the ball. On the other side, the offense has struggled almost as badly this year. Week 6 offers a smash spot for the Falcons to get back on track. **Matt Ryan (upgrade)** offers top-5 upside at quarterback, Arizona is giving up 23.2 FPPG to the position, 4th worst in the NFL. In the second highest projected point total of Week 6, all of the Falcons pass catchers are in play this week as well. **Julio Jones (upgrade)** has been limited through the week but is fully expected to play. Without CB Patrick Peterson (serving the last game of his six game suspension) Jones should be heavily involved and is a good bet to finish as the overall WR1 this week. **Calvin Ridley (upgrade)** has been disappointing the past few weeks, but Arizona’s terrible secondary offers a smash spot for the talent sophomore receiver. Hopefully his target share becomes more consistent as the season moves on, he’s been #4 in the pecking order thus far. **Mohamed Sanu (upgrade)** is also in play this week as a WR3/4 for bye-week needy owners. **Austin Hooper** is a top-3 tight end option against an Arizona team that cannot guard the position, hemorrhaging 16.4 FPPG. The Cardinals linebackers are all sorts of banged up as well, offering even more upside for Hooper.  


**RB Breakdown**


**Devonta Freeman (upgrade)** and **Ito Smith** have split snaps evenly all year, capping Freemans upside. Atlanta’s struggles on offense haven’t helped either, Freeman has seen just 2 carries inside the opponents 10 yard line this year. The Cards run defense isn’t anything to write home about, and this is a great spot for him to breakout of his funk - consider him an RB2 with added upside in PPR leagues due to his consistent pass game usage. 


#**Cardinals**


**Opp (ATL) Pass DVOA:** #30


**Opp (ATL) Run DVOA:** #7


**Injuries to Watch DEF (ATL):** CB Desmond Trufant (OUT) CB Blidi Wreh-Wilson (Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (ARI):** WR Christian Kirk (Q, trending toward playing) WR Damiere Byrd (Q) RB David Johnson (Q, GTD)


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Larry Fitzgerald (22%) Christian Kirk (22%) David Johnson (16%) KeeSean Johnson (13%) Damiere Byrd (13%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** David Johnson (67%, 20, 5) Chase Edmonds (33%, 11, 4)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Air-Raid offense hasn’t produced in the fashion Kingsbury hoped so far, but it’s not all bad, Arizona sits 15th ranked with 363.3 Yds/G. Maybe more importantly, the Cards are 5th in the NFL in plays per game (67.8). Atlanta is 11th (65). There is clearly plenty of room for improvement and the matchup offers a great pace for it. **Kyler Murray (upgrade)** has been getting better every week and should be considered a top-8 QB Sunday. Atlanta boasts a true pass funnel, having a top-10 run defense and second worst pass defense - the Air-Raid should be firing on all cylinders. **Larry Fitzgerald (upgrade)** will be the primary target if **Christian Kirk** is forced to miss another game (currently questionable w/ankle). ATL has been abysmal against the slot, giving up 20.36 FPPG (Next Gen Stats) - Fitz is an upside WR2. It appears Kirk is a game time call, and should be considered a WR2 as well if he suits up - Atlanta is giving up a league worst 31.1 FPPG to wideouts.  Don’t start a tight end in Kingsbury’s offense.


**RB Breakdown**


**David Johnson** is looking like a true game time decision, although it appears he'll try and give it a shot to play. This is the worst case scenario for fantasy owners, and it's likely that backup **Chase Edmonds** is involved even with DJ active to lighten his workload. He needs to be owned across the board. If DJ is forced to miss Sunday’s action, Edmonds will immediately assumed a RB1 workload. Even against ATL’s good run defense, the passing volume for the running backs will keep their floors high.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Le’Veon Bell (84%, 22, 9) Ty Montgomery (13%, 2, 0) Bilal Powell (3%, 1, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Jets savior has returned just in time to possibly flip the script on their disappointing season. **Sam Darnold** will be available for the first time since being diagnosed with mono, but he’s not an option for 1 QB leagues at this point. The offense’s outlook is much improved with Darnold returning as Luke Falk was just awful, but Dallas isn’t a great matchup. **Jamison Crowder (downgrade)** will have better weeks, but the Cowboys are only giving up 12.22 FPPG to slot receivers (Next Gen Stats). **Robbie Anderson (downgrade)** frankly shouldn’t be seeing lineups right now until we see how things play out with Darnold back. Tight end **Chris Herndon (stash)** was set to make his return this week but strained his hamstring last Friday working out. He needs to be owned for his upside, and should be ready to play in a couple weeks as the hammy is only a grade 1 strain. **Ryan Griffin** isn’t a fantasy option.  


**RB Breakdown**


**Le’veon Bell** is getting an RB1 workload but only producing RB2/Flex numbers. The Jets offensive woes haven’t been helping the talented running back, and neither did the year off as he admitted recently. The return of Darnold should improve Bell’s outlook and Dallas isn’t an imposing matchup giving up 21.1 FPPG to running backs. Consider Bell an RB2 with RB1 upside. 


**Cowboys**


**Opp (NYJ) Pass DVOA:** #13

**Injuries to Watch DEF (NYJ):** DL Henry Anderson (D) LB C.J. Mosley (D) LB Jordan Jenkins (Q)

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Ezekiel Elliot (93%, 14, 3) Tony Pollard (7%, 4, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Bill Simmons said in a recent podcast that Dallas might be a “good, bad team”. Essentially meaning they beat up on the bad teams and lose to the good ones. It seems like an accurate description of the Cowboys season so far. The Jets have been mediocre on defense, but it’s probably due to being on the field the entire game as their offense keeps putting them in terrible positions. **Dak Prescott** should be treated as a QB1, but it’s not a smash spot for him or the wideouts. **Amari Cooper** and **Michael Gallup** are both receiving a huge target share, and with **Randall Cobb** popping up on the injury report late week could see more (is that possible?). Cooper is a matchup proof WR1 and Gallup is an upside WR3. If Cobb misses the game, **Devin Smith** will see action but isn’t a recommended play. **Jason Witten** continues to be a low-end TE1 and is an option for desperate owners. At this point outside of the top-3 options, doing well at the tight end position is finding someone to fall into the endzone. 


**RB Breakdown**


The Cowboys may be missing two offensive tackles this week. **Ezekiel Elliot** finished 12-62-1 without T Tyron Smith last week against the Packers back-end run defense. However, this was probably due more in part to the Packers taking a huge lead and forcing Dallas to abandon the run early, rather than offensive line woes. Zeke should be fired up as usual but keep expectations tempered. His volume and goal line work will always provide a high-floor.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Derrick Henry (61%, 20, 0) Dion Lewis (40%, 4, 4)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Titans offense has been a rollercoaster ride this year, and **Marcus Mariota (downgrade)** is a big part of that. In their two wins, he’s gone above 23 fantasy points both times, but in their losses he’s averaged about 13 points. He’s no more than a QB2 streamer, and doesn’t have a great matchup with Denver giving up the 4th fewest FPPG to QBs through 5 weeks. You can likely do better on the wire. **AJ Brown** and **Corey Davis** are early frontrunners for the Jeff Fisher trophy, awarded to the most talented player who is criminally wasted by their team. In Dynasty leagues Brown is one of the better investments considering Mariota isn’t guaranteed to be on this roster past 2019 and his talent is enormous, but the path to consistent fantasy value this season is thin. This week, talented CB Chris Harris Jr. is unlikely to shadow either WR, and with Brown’s snap count was on the rise in Week 5, so he is worth rostering on talent alone. His target share is just too small to trust. Davis has gotten more targets, but outside of a Week 4 TD, has little to show for it. If you have to play one, Brown is the choice simply because he has displayed some major big play ability this year. Neither player is more than a low floor flex play this week. **Delanie Walker (upgrade)** profiles with a better outlook due to his consistently high target share, and is probably the best TD bet amongst receiving options for the Titans as Mariota looks his way consistently in the red zone. Despite two recent duds, Walker is still a borderline TE1 at an extremely thin position.


**RB Breakdown**


Despite a complete lack of involvement in the passing game, **Derrick Henry (upgrade)** has managed to get over 11 points (.5 PPR) in every game this year. The Titans have wisely phased **Dion Lewis (handcuff only)** out of the offense completely, aside for the occasional 2 minute drill or 3rd down situation, leaving a high volume of carries for Henry on a weekly basis. His floor is lower than other elite backs, but Henry remains on the RB1/2 borderline due to his TD upside. The Broncos have been a below average rush-defense by DVOA metrics and have given up the 5th most FPPG to RBs. Henry is a great bet to get into the endzone in what projects as a grind-it-out type game, and will likely exceed 75 yards rushing on volume alone as Tennessee rides him to attempt an upset on the road.

**Injuries to Watch DEF (TEN):** LB Sharif Finch (OUT), DE Cameron Wake (OUT), CB Chris Milton (Q)

**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Courtland Sutton (23%) Emmanuel Sanders (21%) Phillip Lindsay (14%) Royce Freeman (12%) Noah Fant (10%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Phillip Linsday (46%, 19, 4) Royce Freeman (54%, 15, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Things haven’t come easy for the Broncos this year, but a win against the Chargers last week was a huge step in the right direction. **Joe Flacco (I wouldn’t)** has been able to sustain two fantasy relevant RBs and WRs so far this year, somewhat to the surprise of preseason predictions. However, Flacco himself is only in consideration as a streamer these days, and going up against a stout Titans defense in a likely low scoring game, this is not the game to try your luck. **Courtland Sutton** has slightly overtaken **Emmanuel Sanders** on the season for overall target share, but both work in tandem as dual lead receivers for Flacco. The Titans are not especially tough against the pass, but do have a solid secondary. This feels like a game that Denver would win with defense and a strong running game, and the likelihood of a shootout does not seem high. Both Sutton and Sanders are in play as WR3s this week, and Sutton is the slightly preferred play due to his recent hot streak. If defenses start treating Sutton as the #1, it’s possible Sanders could break out in the next few weeks, but it may just be that Sutton is slowly overtaking the veteran as the lead dog here. **Noah Fant** is not getting the necessary volume to be trusted and is a low-end TE2 that you are hoping finishes with a 2-50-1 line. Don’t do it unless you are really desperate.


**RB Breakdown**


The split between **Phillip Lindsay (upgrade PPR)** and **Royce Freeman (downgrade)** has been almost exactly even this season, but Lindsay has done slightly more with his touches the past few weeks. His involvement in the passing game gives him a higher floor than Freeman, despite Freeman playing slightly more snaps, so he’s a safer start than his counterpart. The Titans have been vulnerable to pass catching backs in previous weeks, giving up the 8th most receptions to opposing RBs, but overall are solid against the run (9th fewest FPPG to RBs). Lindsay is a low-end RB2 with more upside in PPR, and Freeman is a bye week flex option, albeit one that likely needs a rushing TD to get over 10 points for only the second time this year (.5 PPR). Lindsay’s 3 rush TDs to Freeman’s 0 rush TDs are a concerning trend for Freeman owners, and a welcome sight for those riding the Lip Lindsay train.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Watching **Mason Rudolph** go limp was a scary sight last week, but miraculously he was able to practice throughout this week. He was ruled out, however, and the Steelers have named **Devlin Hodges** the starting QB for Week 6. Hodges is an easy avoid in all formats and any depth, but its not clear how much of a drop off he is from Rudolph in terms of keeping the Steelers weapons fantasy relevant. Hodges spread out his targets pretty evenly amongst the Steelers passing options in his short week 5 audition. **Juju Smith Schuster** finished with perhaps his most complete game of the season, but with Hodges now the starting QB he can’t be trusted as more than a WR2 at this point. He got 2 targets from Hodges, but figures to be the clear top option for the rookie. **James Washington** has been ruled out “for a couple weeks” (Rotoworld) further increasing the likelihood of Schuster’s high target share. Stud CB Casey Hayward typically hasn’t travelled into the slot, so Juju’s not expected to be in a true shadow matchup. Start him, but keep expectations in check. **Diontae Johnson (downgrade)** had been gaining some momentum the past few weeks, but gets a bigger downgrade with Rudolph’s absence. He’s a dart throw WR4/5 in this matchup. **Vance McDonald (upgrade)** appears close to full health, and got three targets in his return last week. He makes for an interesting play as the safety valve for a rookie QB going up against a strong pass rush, but is still only a borderline top 10 option due to the uncertainty of role. The Chargers are middle of the pack against TEs, so his matchup is not a downgrade to his outlook.


**RB Breakdown**


The Steelers injury troubles continued last week, as they lost **Jaylen Samuels (drop shallow leagues)** to a knee injury that will keep him out for about a month. This opens up additional carries and targets for **James Conner (upgrade PPR)** who should now be the centerpiece of the offense. Conner still has yet to get over 55 rushing yards on the season, but will be a popular target of the rookie QB this week, so he needs to stay locked into lineups. He’s a high-end RB2 this week in PPR, and a low-end RB2 in standard leagues.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Melvin Gordon (46%, 16, 6) Austin Ekeler (66%, 18, 16)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Chargers offense looked extremely out of sync against the Broncos last week, and it appears that injuries and poor play along the offensive line may be catching up to them. The Steelers have been much better defensively since adding Minkah Fitzpatrick, so they are no longer a cushy matchup for opposing QBs. **Phillip Rivers (downgrade)** put up a dud in Week 5 after back to back 20+ point weeks, and may lean more heavily on the run game in likely positive game flow. He has potential for 250 and 2 TDs, but is no more than an upper tier QB2 that could be streamed if an owner is short due to bye weeks. **Keenan Allen (upgrade)** was inexplicably covered by LBs on a high % of his routes when he matched up against the Steelers last year, and should be heavily targeted in the short to intermediate pass game if the Chargers O-Line continues to struggle. He is still in the WR1 ranks. **Mike Williams (downgrade)** put up a solid 6-74 line in Week 5, but still has yet to reach the endzone. The combination of a stout pass defense, likely positive game flow, and the lack of protection for Rivers to take deep shots all point to a downgrade for Williams. If you are starting him, you’re hoping he can get in the endzone. **Hunter Henry (stash)** returned to a limited practice on Thursday and is officially questionable to play, but may be on a snap count if he does. He isn’t a trustworthy Week 6 option, but needs to be universally owned as he will be back to the TE1 ranks likely by next week.


**RB Breakdown**


The Week 5 return of **Melvin Gordon (upgrade standard)** didn’t yield immediate results for the Chargers, but a bigger Week 6 role is likely in the cards. **Austin Ekeler (upgrade PPR)** isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, but Gordon should get 15+ carries and 4+ targets, and has a good chance for a TD as a home favorite against a middle of the pack rush defense. Treat him as an RB2 who may struggle for consistent yardage as long as the Chargers O-Line is undermanned. Ekeler received an incredible 16 targets in Week 5, so is obviously still in the game plan moving forward. As Gordon gets up to speed, Ekeler may be stuck in the 5-8 carry range, but remains an RB2 in PPR leagues due to his pass game involvement. He’s a big play machine, so don’t hesitate to get him in your lineup for at least another week.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Coming off of a Week 5 bye, this will be a true test for whether **Matthew Stafford (downgrade)** can put up good numbers against an above average defense. The Packers have given up the 7th fewest FPPG to opposing QBs, and rank as a top 5 pass defense by DVOA. We expect a heavy dose of the run game and at least one interception from the GB defense, so we have him outside the top 12 this week. He is still a high-end QB2 due to his weapons and increased tendency to take deep shots this year, but the volume may not be there as much in this matchup. **Kenny Golladay (upgrade standard)** has only gotten over 67 yards once this season in 4 games, but has gotten in the endzone 4 times. He gets a slight downgrade in PPR, and will take aim at a difficult matchup with excellent Packers’ CBs, but is a solid WR2 based on TD upside and his status as the #1 option in this offense. **Marvin Jones (downgrade)** may see a bit more of rising star CB Jaire Alexander, so he is a riskier start with a low floor but an obviously high ceiling. Consider him a boom-bust WR3 in this difficult matchup. **TJ Hockenson (downgrade)** appears on track to play, but still needs to officially pass concussion protocol. Assuming he’s healthy, he is a high-end TE2 due to the scarcity of depth at the position, but will likely need to get into the endzone to be a worthwhile start. Because he plays on Monday night, owners may be forced to go in another direction if he hasn’t been cleared by the early kickoffs on Sunday morning. With Danny Amendola a limited participant in practice and likely to play, that makes Hockenson’s path to targets all the more challenging.

The Lions showed an improved run game in Week 4 against the Chiefs, and **Kerryon Johnson** finally got the workhorse treatment owners had been waiting for. Fresh off a rest week, KJ goes up against a Packers rush D that has struggled by DVOA metrics and given up the 3rd most FPPG to RBs. We have him as a top-12 play this week in a game he should see a heavy workload. The Lions best chance for a road upset is to feed the beast and keep the Aaron’s off the field. **Ty Johnson** and **J.D McKissick** are reportedly battling for the #2 role, so neither makes for an attractive handcuff until one emerges. KJ is the man, and has a good shot at a big game in Week 6.


#**Packers**


**Opp (DET) Pass DVOA:** #12


**Opp (DET) Run DVOA:** #14


**Injuries to Watch DEF (DET):** DT Mike Daniels (OUT), Amani Oruwariye (OUT), CB Darius Slay (limited, Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (GB):** Davante Adams (DNP, Doubtful), Q Aaron Rodgers (limited Friday, likely to play) 


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Davante Adams (25%) Marquez Valdes-Scantling (18%) Aaron Jones (13%) Jimmy Graham (11%) Geronimo Allison (11%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Aaron Jones (68%, 26, 8) Jamaal Williams *Week 3 (61%, 14, 2)


QB/WR/TE Breakdown


Owners of **Aaron Rodgers (downgrade)** had to be frustrated last week watching him hand off the ball to Aaron Jones in the red zone time and time again. Had he been able to turn even two of those drives into passing TDs his line would have been much more appetizing. This is perhaps a sign of things to come, however, as the Packers are content to run the ball heavily this season. We project somewhat of a bounce back game this week, at least in the TD department, but missing his top weapon lowers his upside significantly. View Rodgers as a back-end QB1 that can be benched if owners have another high-end option with a better matchup. With **Davante Adams** likely out this week due to his turf toe injury (DNP Friday), **Marquez Valdes-Scantling** becomes the de-facto #1 WR again this week. That role didn’t yield much last week, but keeps him in the low-end WR3/4 range. **Darius Slay**, a top level CB who often shadows opposing #1s, is questionable to play with a hammy issue, and his absence would presumably be an upgrade for MVS. **Geronimo Allison (drop)** struggled to cash in on opportunity last week as well, and doesn’t appear to be a big part of the game plan at this point. He’s a threat to get in the end zone, but can’t be viewed as more than a WR4/5 at this point. **Jimmy Graham (upgrade)** got a slight uptick in work sans Adams last week, and remains on the TE1 radar simply due to his QB looking his way on a few jump balls every week. He’s the most likely of the Packers receiving options to hit the end zone this week, and should be in most lineups unless owners have a top-6 option as an alternative.


**RB Breakdown**


The hashtag-FreeAaronJones movement finally got some traction last week as he racked up 4 rushing TDs and 182 total yards. **Jones** got a bigger workload with **Jamaal Williams (handcuff only)** sidelined due to his concussion, and rewarded owners with a monster game. Williams returns this week, so Jones may lose a few touches, but remains a solid RB1 due to his strong O-Line, elite defense, and usage in the red zone. Williams can only be viewed as a handcuff for Jones owners, and shouldn’t be in any lineups, outside of extremely deep leagues, in his first game back from injury.

Mecole Hardman Role Once Hill Returns,"There has been a lot of talk of Hill this week with his potential return, but not a lot of discussion around how this will impact the playing time of the other WRs. It was mainly Hardman who filled in for Hill week 1 when he went down.

Is there a chance that Hardman sees a significant reduction in playing time upon Hill’s return, and the 3 WR sets are Hill, Robinson, and Pringle (since Watkins is likely out)? Anybody have good insight into their projected packages with Hill?

Edit: A lot of the comments don’t seem to be taking Watkins missing time into account. This is something to consider and we haven’t seen what their personnel looks like with Hill in and Watkins out",32,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dh2m7w/mecole_hardman_role_once_hill_returns/,3242.1669702013332,r/fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

**Get the advice you need to finally make a decision about your lineup**

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you’re thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he’s been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn’t work out for you, don’t come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don’t do it!

Which DE stands to gain the most from the opposing team's recent O-Line changes.,"Nick bosa just wrecked the browns, still not sure if this is an indictment on the browns or more telling of Bosa's skill as a DE. The Rams O-line is rated the worst in the NFL per pff.

The 49ers have lost RT Mcglinchey, Juscwyzk (albeit primarily blocking FB) and have been pretty good despite being without LT Joe Staley.  Jusczyk was replaced by TE Ross Dwelley and subsequent runs went for little or no gain.

WR depth add - the case for Robbie Anderson,"Oh Robbie, where have you been. After finishing last season finally building a connection with Sam Darnold, seeing double digit targets and stretching the field like you do at your best, you’ve completely  fallen off the radar along with the rest of the Jet’s offense. In fact, you are currently only owned in about 50% of all leagues, depending on the host. Justifiably so based on your near non-existence this season to date. Here is why I’m adding you as depth to my teams where available. 

* Yes you have sucked, and I mean sucked. To start the season however you have played Buf, Cle, and NE (all top ten defenses in points allowed to WR) - plus Phil, which would be the only good matchup. Even in a good matchup, your QB couldn’t throw the ball accurately downfield if it was on a zip line. Simply put, nobody has stood a chance in this offense, but...

* Sam Darnold has returned from the dreaded kissing disease. I’m advocating a depth add here, because simply put, we can’t expect Darnold to return to form after an illness related absence like this first game, but...

* Bye weeks are coming in full swing, and injuries are joining them. Pickings are thin at WR, and if you’re scouting the waiver wire you’ll likely not see too many appealing adds. While the Jet’s early situation and schedule have been brutal, things are looking up because...

* Rest of season schedule for the Jets is like a complete reversal of the first five weeks. After Dallas and a dreaded match up with NE, the schedule turns to cupcake mode. Eight of their last nine games are against bottom half WR points per game defense. The likes of the Miami Dolphins, *twice!* Oak, Was, the Giants. This schedule sets up for a strong finish, and what could be a valuable add if you are hurting at WR.

Fantasy is a lot of luck, but taking all of this into account, I feel this is an add that can pay off through the end of the season. It’s likely your league is in free agency mode until tomorrow’s games start. If you’re looking for depth and a potential situational starter, Anderson might just be your ticket.",49,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dh167w/wr_depth_add_the_case_for_robbie_anderson/,3358.50030383269,r/fantasyfootball

Can we trust Adrian Peterson one last time?,"Peterson (along with the rest of the Redskins) has been a complete dumpster fire so far. QB carousel, Gruden gets fired and a lackluster Defense has made this team play from behind every game so far. This has led to limited touches for AP and some very low scores thus far.

But now they get to play the only other team that looks worse then them, the Dolphins. Miami has given up the most points to RB’s and Washington’s interim coach has already said he wants to lean heavily on the  RB’s this game.  If there was ever a time to start the walking hall of famer, it’s this week. Is anyone else feeling like taking the risk of starting him, or should we play it a bit safer with someone else.

No love for Tevin Coleman,"For some reason Coleman is getting no respect from experts this week and beyond and I can't figure out why. He came back into a lead rushing role with the best rushing offence in football. His first game back (in a blowout) he had a 36% snap count and led the team with 16 touches. 

While Brieda's stat line looked better, removing his first touch of the game he had 10 carries for 31 yards. Now obviously a player as skilled as Breida has the potential to break a run like that every game and that's why he will continue to be valuable but Tevin was ripping off chunk plays at ease. He had a 6.1 ypc with a long of 19 yards. That's insane efficiency.

This week he plays the Rams, which may be the best defense they have faced but they just finished allowing 136 yards rushing and another 36 in the air to RB's against a team very similar to the 9ers.

Even though Breida got a redzone receiving TD last game, most people feel like Coleman is the redzone back and Jeff Wilson proved how valuable that is. Coleman is also a good pass catcher and even though he didn't catch a ball last game I don't expect that to be the norm. He caught 2 balls for 33 yards in less than a half week 1

With all that it amazes me how low he is being ranked this week. Boris Chen hasn't been updated since thursday but fantasy pros has him somewhere around RB 31 around guys like Freeman, Sanders and McCoy, all of which appear to be the 1B in a RBBC. Breida is sitting almost 10 spots ahead of him at RB 23.

Is Tyreek Hill a Sell high or hold hard?,"The case for hold:
Tyreek hill is expected to return this week (fingers crossed) and will have a extremely favorable match up against the Texans who have given up the 7th most points to Wr, he is also expected to get a serious number of targets due to a lack luster reciever set that lacks consistency everywhere but TE pos, and with watkins injured it's not gona get any better, this indicates a really high amount of points for tyreek in the weeks to come  

The Case for Selling high: he has good value to the before hand, however after this Texans game hes got a really tough ROS including 2 games against deaver, chicago, and New england...
On top of that he may still miss this game or at least some snaps this game due to still recovering... and to top it all off with this injury there is a high change of reaggrivating the injury... with all of this being known there is a good chance that this is currently the highest hes going to be worth all season being value right around Leonard fournettes level.

Need a TE this weekend? The case for Geoff Swain as a bye-week fill-in,"Okay, hear me out - Swain isn't a sexy pick. He's not a great pick. He might be average.

But at TE, that might be enough. Here is the breakdown for teams that target the TE the most:

* [Top 10 targets at TE](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/reports/targets-distribution/te.php?year=2019&start=1&end=5&show=totals)

See #10? That's the Jags, whose current #1 TE - James O'Shaughnessy - was put on IR this past week. What's interesting is that before he was hurt, the target share between O'Shaughnessy and Swaim was as such through five games:

* O'Shaughnessy - 20 targets
* Swaim - 15 targets

What's more interesting are the two TE's routes run percentages and red-zone rates:

[O'Shaughnessy](https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/james-oshaughnessy/):

* Snap Share = 61.9%  (27.0% slot)
* Route Participation = 48.6%
* Target Share = 11.8%  (23.5% rz)

[Swaim](https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/geoff-swaim/): 

* Snap Share = 49.5%  (27.0% slot)
* Route Participation = 33.5% 
* Target Share = 8.9%  (5.9% rz)


Between the two men, nearly 30% of all red-zone targets were coming their way. Now that O'Shaughnessy is out for the year, Swaim's numbers likely won't go up to the point of being an every-week starter. But the potential is there for increased red-zone looks and a much higher target share against a team - New Orleans - that is squarely average against the TE position. 

That said, there's quite a bit to like here. The Jags were already top 10 in targets to their TEs. Considering how often they throw at them in the red-zone and that another TE - Seth DeValve - will likely take the Swaim role now, there's a good chance Swaim makes you feel less despair at the TE position this weekend. 

He also has a True Catch Rate of 85.7% on his targets, and, if you're playing in a PPR or half-PPR league, it's not unreasonable to expect a decent performance from this guy. Plus, he's already used to running routes at the slot, which means he could - if needed - play the same role as O'Shaughnessy in that position. 

Don't except miracles. Expect an average performance, one that won't hurt your team, and you'll be fine. Sometimes winning means guarding against goose eggs, and Swaim seems like a good fit to help us avoid that fate.

Good luck this weekend. 👍",215,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgyf5c/need_a_te_this_weekend_the_case_for_geoff_swain/,3574.5503042022387,r/fantasyfootball

I don’t know how often this scenario plays out for other league owners o but it’s looking likely for me to do so.",17,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgy0vg/a_starting_lineup_only_composed_of_players_from/,3605.2336375991504,r/fantasyfootball
Tracking Fantasy Footballers Starts of the Week- stats through week 5,"I get bored at work a lot. I also like listening to the Fantasy Footballers podcast. One of their segments I enjoy other than just their overall rankings is their Starts of the Week. These past few weeks have me wondering: just how accurate are their predictions?

So I threw together a little spreadsheet tracking all of their weekly picks and their rankings through the weeks.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kJkVmGUA6ZQOLqUl2EVwvO8u2XX1LoQY

All of the scores are using ESPN standard scoring right now. I might be adding PPR in a later revision. EDIT: ESPN standard PPR has been added as a second tab. 

TL;DR - Mike has been the most accurate through week 5, with 11 of his 20 picks ending up in the top 12 for their position (10 for PPR).

Fun fact: So far this year, Jason has not picked a kicker that finished outside the top 24.",20,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgy04y/tracking_fantasy_footballers_starts_of_the_week/,3606.7336376150447,r/fantasyfootball

Maximizing Your (Kickoff) Return on Investment: Week 6,"Back and ready to talk everything about returners for week 6. As always these posts are targeted for people who are in leagues that score return yards with the preferred scoring being 1 point per 10 return yards. 

Desmond King was the only guy to run one back last week with a nice 68-yard return. Brandon Wilson and Cordarrelle Patterson were the closest to hit the century mark with a 97-yard and 93-yard game, respectively. 

Hope everyone’s week goes well. [Here are the projections for week 6.](https://mobile.twitter.com/SLFootballGuys/status/1181742559271559168/photo/1)

Good Returners for Week 6:

Tyler Lockett (KR/PR) - Most likely will be returning kicks Sunday, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Penny gets action from deep. Lockett has been more productive in that department so I wouldn’t expect that to change. Even if Penny gets the call, Lockett should get some chances in the punt game as Cleveland has shown to struggle to move the ball this season.

Mecole Hardman (KR) - Mecole went back to kick return duties last week and I would imagine he would stay with it with Tyreek’s  return to the field coming in the next few weeks. Houston’s touchback percentage is bottom 10 in the league and with how susceptible Houston’s secondary has been he’s a play you can be confident in after a down week last week.

JoJo Natson (KR/PR) - Hasn’t done a whole lot so far this year, but that should change this week. San Francisco has been putting up points this year and when you combine that with a 50% touchback percentage on the year (46.67% on the road), that’s a recipe for a big day for the returner of the Rams.

Tremon Smith (KR) - IDP special of the week, this is a perfect return matchup as the Lions have the worst touchback percentage in the league at 34.78%. Should have plenty of chances on Monday night.

Returners I’m Fading for Week 6:

Miles Sanders (KR) - Not seeing much upside in this matchup against Minnesota for Sanders. Not only has the Vikings’ defense been solid against the run, but they’ve been rocking an 80% touchback percentage on kickoffs. 

Jakeem Grant (KR/PR) - I can absolutely see some broken plays in this game and Jakeem can be a part of some, but this seems too risky of a play this week. Washington has kicked off at a touchback percentage of 75% and his chances seem limited.

Dontrell Hilliard (KR) - He had a solid return game last week, but this week isn’t a great matchup for him. Seattle has kicked a touchback on 84% of kicks this year and since he hasn’t had much offensive involvement since his concussion week 1, he’s a strong fade this week.

For those of you that want to see these calculations before waivers each week, I’ll have them up on our [twitter every Tuesday night.](https://mobile.twitter.com/SLFootballGuys)",11,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgx6ul/maximizing_your_kickoff_return_on_investment_week/,3669.6669710675874,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Last Minute Advice] - Sat Afternoon, 10/12/2019","#Last Minute Advice Thread

**Get the advice you need to finally make a decision about your lineup**

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you’re thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he’s been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn’t work out for you, don’t come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don’t do it!

Steelers Backfield: No Use for Snell?,"Is there a reason nobody is talking about Benny Snell?

Jaylen has a lot of vacated snaps being out for the next month of so and with ""Deal With the Devlin"" Hodges under center, they may lean on the run or short game more.

It seems like Snell could step right into a role along side Conner, especially since he hasn't exactly lived up to his own hype. Is it worth trying to stash him in deeper leagues? Is the volume enough for him like it almost was for Samuels? Or is he just not as good of a player?",30,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgwsun/steelers_backfield_no_use_for_snell/,3700.300304865837,r/fantasyfootball

8. PHI (Vikings @ WASH play them here)
9. WASH
10. CLE
11. Back to MIA

What players from your team are currently injured but could return? What are the fantasy implications?,"So I was thinking about the Patriots injury situation and who might be able to return at some point which got me wondering - what impact players on other teams could come back at some point and affect fantasy football?  

​

For instance, the Patriots have a few players on IR that could potentially return, the most likely to have a big impact being left tackle Isaiah Wynn.  Wynn had won the starting left tackle job until a toe injury landed him on IR but pretty much everyone around the team is suggesting he is a lock to be chosen as one of the IR guys to return.  He would be eligible week 11.  Getting Wynn back could improve the entire offense but the three guys it would likely impact the most are Sony Michel, Brady, and Ryan Izzo.  

​

Michel and Brady are obvious ones but Izzo could see a bump into relevancy for really deep leagues or daily fantasy.  With Wynn out, Izzo has been asked to stay in and block a ton - he played 79 snaps this week but only ran 31 routes and was asked to pass block on 12 pass plays which isn't sustainable usage for a fantasy tight end (most viable TEs block on 10% or less of pass plays and over the last 4 weeks Izzo has blocked on 26% of his).  Obviously we don't know for sure if his usage would change and it would be tough to rely on him in fantasy playoffs in any real league but something to think about.  In week 5 the Pats didn't have much trouble with the Redskins defense so Izzo didn't block on any pass plays and he scored a touchdown.  

​

You can only bring 2 guys back from IR so the options for the second spot would likely be James Develin in week 12 (boost for Sony) or N'Keal Harry in week 9 (he didn't look great in preseason but him getting snaps upon his return would likely hurt Dorsett, if anyone).   Rookie lineman Yodny Cajuste is also on the NFI list and the Pats already played their week 6 game so he can come back at any point moving forward.  

​

So what about your favorite NFL team?  Any guys that are slated to return at some point that the rest of us should know about? (especially if it's under the radar a bit, we all know about AJ Green)",28,0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgwc38/what_players_from_your_team_are_currently_injured/,3737.2503049532575,r/fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Get the advice you need to finally make a decision about your lineup**

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you’re thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he’s been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn’t work out for you, don’t come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don’t do it!

* SF (34) @ LA (13) -- Brown had 54 yards

For either of those two parties, what is Hunter Henry's value for the rest of the season, or is it too early to tell?

Has Christopher Harris lost his way a bit? Am i alone in thinking this?,"The last few years i would listen to podcasts nonstop at work,  the footballers, cbs, and harris.  harris always gave the best insight to everything in my eyes.  less entertaining than the other shows but his info was better.  this year i made an effort to not listen to any podcasts so i could focus on my gut instincts and not be swayed in my drafts by others influence.  the previous 2 years i went with the ""experts"" advice on sleepers and what not and they were the most miserable years of my 11 year fantasy life.  

well its like a third through the season and i started to listen to hear recaps of games.  the first harris podcast i listened to he badmouthed the commentating of a game and played a clip from a sideline reporter for like 5 minutes.  like cool i get what they say on tv isnt exactly the most hard hitting journalism but thats not what i tune in for.  the second harris podcast i listen to he is basically saying how much better he is than other shows because he doesnt go by just stats.   


i remember from like 2 years ago he was basically claiming that he was the only one to call that gurley was gonna be a stud after his abysmal 2nd year, even berry called that gurley was gonna be a stud that year.  i havent listened to any shows where he has guests on this year but last year it seemed like he basically dismissed all of their arguments as ""crutch"" arguments and that he was right no matter what.  the episode i listened to today was him just reading twitter comments of people that agreed with his views.  i turned it off before cousin josh came on which is a shame because cousin josh reminds me of Steve Buschemi.

his ""snark"" has always irritated me and he seems like he is just so full of himself.  his nicknames for players is always garbage to me but i kept listening because he gave great insight.  now i cant even get through a full podcast because i cant take his ""snark"".  anyone else feel this way?

Edit: thanks for the insight  /u/extrapudding",234,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgrvdb/has_christopher_harris_lost_his_way_a_bit_am_i/,4205.500305302938,r/fantasyfootball
Why David Johnson Will Score Below His Projection This Week,"David Johnson's main production this season has come through the air. The cardinals throw to their running backs 22% of their attempts (This is 7th in the league). When it comes to rushing yards and touchdowns David Johnson is middle of the pack with 264 yards and 1 touchdown on 64 runs. The 2nd string running back Chase Edmonds has 127 rushing yards and a touchdown on a measly 19 carries.

They are taking on an Atlanta Defense that doesn't do anything very well, except for forcing incomplete passes to running backs. They force in-completions to running backs 65% of the time. This is fifth best in the league. The Falcons give up the highest completion rate to wide receivers in the entire league at 67% of the time.

The Cardinals throw it to their wide receivers on 72% of pass plays. I see the cardinals completely abandoning the targets to the running backs this week and moving the ball easily. The rushing TD's will go to Murray who has more rushing TD's than both running backs.

This leaves DJ to rely on passing yards and completions. For whatever reason the Falcons can shut down the pass catching running backs this year. So look for DJ to score below his projection.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

The case for Malcolm Brown and more so why SF's Run Defense may not be as good as we think.,"So far I've seen many people say they're not starting Brown because of SF's strong run D. So far they have been stellar, shutting down team's run games, however, this may be a bit misleading based on who they've played.

Week 1 they played the stellar RB duo of Peyton Barber and Ronald Jones. hese two combined for 21/108/0 - Good for a 5.1 YPC

Week 2 they played an injured Joe Mixon and a Bengals putrid OL. They shut them down and held he and Gio to an impressive 17/23/0 statline. A good game but we have to remember that Mixon was hurt going into the week and the Bengals were down 14 going into half and 24 in the fourth. Absolute horrid game script to boot.

Week 3 they did a good job combating James Conner, holding him to 13/43/0. Pretty average for what Conner has done the past three weeks. Not hard to scheme against the Steelers with Rudolph at QB. Conner's statlines were similar against BAL (14/55/1) and CIN (10/42/0).

Last week Chubb had 16/87/0 good for a 5.4 YPC with another 12 yards on a catch and run.

**TL;DR:** So far this Defense hasn't been tested by anything near what the Rams are bringing Sunday. They've played the Bucs with Evans sick, Bengals with Mixon hurt, Rudolph led Steelers and smoked the Browns at home last week. They've been good so far. Quite impressive compared to last year, but they're not the Bears or Jags of recent years. I'm sure SF is more focused on stopping Kupp and the Rams vertical attack than Brown. Should make for a good day underneath. I expect a Chubb like game for him with maybe a little fewer touches.",174,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dglyzc/the_case_for_malcolm_brown_and_more_so_why_sfs/,4766.450305982431,r/fantasyfootball

A low of all lows: starting a Miami Dolphin on offense,"This week the Dolphins will play the abysmal Washington defense. Although this might seem like a “sneaky” start for WR Preston Williams, it might not be what you’re expecting. Although he’s consistently put up 10, 8, 9, and 7, what makes him a sneaky play for this week? Well he’s getting 62% of the touches in the red-zone for the Dolphins, but on the other hand, Miami has only had 8 of those opportunities all year. Even though he’s playing the Redskins, Miami WR Albert Wilson is returning this week, so between Williams, Wilson, and Parker, Preston might not get as many targets this week. I’d recommended only starting him if you’re desperate, like me.",69,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dglwcj/a_low_of_all_lows_starting_a_miami_dolphin_on/,4772.5836393515265,r/fantasyfootball

"With all the recent RB1 injuries, consider Adrian Peterson for this week.","Peterson has admittedly been bad this so far year and is available in about 50% of ESPN leagues still. 


However if there is anytime for a good week from him it’s this week. It’s well known Miami’s defense is abysmal, and they’ve allowed the second most points to fantasy RBs this year (most in standard). 


This game also figures to have better gamescripts for Peterson than Washington’s other games this year. These 2 teams will be lucky to combine for 4 wins this season and this figures to be a close game since they’re both dogshit.


With all the RB injuries this week I think Peterson could have a solid game this week. I could see something like 70-80 yards with TD potential. This is the perfect matchup for him.


TL;DR: Miami’s run defense is terrible and positive gamescript for Washington running this week will make Peterson a RB2/flex this week.",35,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgkstv/with_all_the_recent_rb1_injuries_consider_adrian/,4857.03363964955,r/fantasyfootball

Buy high on Jacobs,"Last week's 22 point affair was no fluke. I like Jacobs ROS more than some of the other backs in the 3rd tier including Ingram, Henry, and maybe even Bell. If you're able to trade for Josh Jacobs this week, I would definitely pull the trigger.

1. Schedule 

According to FantasyPros, the Raiders have the 4th easiest schedule for RBs for the rest of the season. This includes the Bengals (31st), Chiefs (30th), Packers (26th), and Chargers twice (18th). In games like vs Denver and vs Chicago when Gruden leaned on the run-game, Jacobs saw 20+ attempts and found the end zone twice in each game.

2. Offensive Line 

Every year it seems like people get burned at the RB position (it’s me, I’m people) and if it's not because of injury or usage, there's usually one reason why. Players like Bell, Mixon, and Devonta Freeman are all under performing their ADP for one reason: absolute dog shit offensive line. Bell actually has the easiest ROS schedule for RBs but the problem is his offensive line ranks 32nd in run blocking, putting up 3.02 Adj. Line Yards/Attempt with a 28% Stuffed rate (31st). Going back to Jacobs though, the Raiders offensive line ranks 4th in run blocking with 5.06 Adj. Line Yards/Attempt and a 12% Stuffed Rate (3rd). Basically that offensive line makes more holes than Shia Labeouf at a juvenile detention camp and with the way Jacobs runs it's a great recipe.

3. Volume/Scheme 

A little baptism by fire helped Gruden figure out that the Raiders must absolutely build their offensive scheme around Jacobs. They started off with this game plan Week 1 when Jacobs saw a 74% of Offensive Snaps but then his usage regressed in the subsequent weeks: 46%, 42%, and 54 % respectively. In Week 5, with Tyrell Williams out, they were forced to lean on him once again and the result was 68% Off. Snap Pct and 27.8 Fantasy Points (0.5 PPR).

But Gruden has always been a punch-in-the-mouth kind of coach. He's invested heavily in the run game as evident by his offensive line. Waller helps open up the box as well as provides very solid run-blocking. And then there's the fullback Alec Ingold who has been vital to Jacobs' success. Gruden mentioned in his press conference how Ingold's blocking was crucial in the two scores during the Bears game.

*FINAL THOUGHT*

If it's not too late to process your trade this week or have your commissioner push it through before Sunday, I suggest trying to trade for Jacobs this week. Partially this is because he is on BYE and you may be able to sauce over an active RB this week for extra value. Mostly though, I think Jacobs is going to pop off for the rest of the season so go grab that man and never look back.",222,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgj4ig/buy_high_on_jacobs/,4981.733640217781,r/fantasyfootball
"Petition to rename ""ROS"" threads","Considering we started ""Rest of Season"" threads for each player after every single week, we should just call them ""Rest of Week"" (ROW).

I still think there is a place for ROS threads, for instance after a big trade or injury... but if we're just going to repose the question because the player had a good or bad game, they just just be called ROW.

Knock on wood if you're with me.

Tyler Boyd Breakdown (With and Without AJ Green '18-'19),"**Tyler Boyd Breakdown (With and Without AJ Green '18-'19)**

I've been reading a lot of comments saying things like ""Boyd will be better when AJ returns"" or ""Boyd won't be as good when AJ returns"". So I wanted to put some stats together from last year and this year for some more information. Interested to see how people will interpret these stats in the comments. Scoring is .5 PPR. 

**TL;DR/Analysis**

||Games|Tgt|Rec|Yds|Y/R|TD|Ctch%|Y/Tgt|Snp Pct|Fantasy|STDEV|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|With AJ|8|8.25|**6.13**|**77.50**|12.39|**0.63**|**73%**|**9.32**|86%|**14.56**|8.46|
|Without AJ|11|**8.55**|5.82|74.00|**13.54**|0.27|68%|9.08|**88%**|11.95|**5.52**|

* Boyd's targets get a slight bump when AJ is out
* Boyd's Y/R does go up when AJ is out. 
* Fantasy points per game increases when AJ plays, but he is less consistent. 
* TD rate significantly drops without AJ.
* Receptions and yards per game are pretty close to the same.
* Catch rate is lower this year, due to Andy Dalton being worse and a new offense (imo)

Personally, I think that Boyd will continue to be pretty close to the same player when AJ comes back, fantasy-wise. I believe the only thing holding him back right now is TDs. Whether those will come or not, I'm not sure. 

**Game by game stats below with averages...**

Here we have Weeks 10-15. AJ came back to play in Week 13 but left shortly after the game started, only playing 25% of snaps and receiving 1 target. For that reason, I've included Week 13 in this set of games. Also of note - Boyd left Week 15 early due to injury and only played 49% of snaps.

He can be considered a back-end QB1. **Curtis Samuel (upgrade)**  and **D.J. Moore (upgrade)**  were both victims of Newton’s struggles in the first meeting of the year, but Tampa’s secondary was ripe for exploitation - Newton just couldn’t get the ball to his speedy receivers, missing Samuel on several deep throws or getting the ball to him late, causing him to be tackled well short of where the play could have gone. TB is giving up the most FPPG to opposing wideouts and Carolina will begin to hit on the deep ball at some point, this week could very well be it. Consider both upside WR3’s. **Greg Olsen**  also draws an extremely favorable matchup, TB is giving up the second most FPPG to tight ends (12.5) and Olsen should be considered a top-6 tight end this week.      


**RB Breakdown** 


**Christian McCaffery**  continues to eat and is still in the mix for the overall RB1, even going against the best run defense in the league so far. His involvement in all facets of the game keep his floor high. He’s questionable but expected to play, owners should grab **Reggie Bonnafun**  in case CMC’s health goes sideways before kickoff.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The roller coaster ride of having **Jameis Winston** on your fantasy squad continues to provide it’s peaks and valleys. There have been more peaks this season than years past and Winston is the #10 QB through 5 weeks. Even in a down week loss to the Saints last week, Winston put up a respectable 17.5 fantasy points and didn’t turn the ball over once. It’s possible he’s turned a corner, but it’s also just as likely that the next bust week is right around the corner… The emergence of **Chris Godwin** has certainly helped the oft-scrutinized quarterback, and Godwin has become a true WR1 in fantasy - he’s sitting pretty as the overall WR1 through 5 weeks. Godwin’s ascent has brought fellow wideout **Mike Evans** back to earth, as he only saw 3 targets last week in his duel with Saints stud CB Marcus Lattimore. Next on deck is a matchup with another elite CB in James Bradberry, a player that has thwarted Evans multiple times in his career, including their last matchup in Week 2. Consider Evans a feast-or-famine WR2 this week in the bad matchup. With field stretcher **Breshad Perriman** not traveling to London, tight end **O.J Howard**  is in a position to gain a larger target share. It may not matter however, as the Panthers have the leagues fifth-best defense against tight ends, only giving up a stingy 4 FPPG to the position. Howard is impossible to trust at this point and should be considered a TE2. 


**RB Breakdown** 


**Peyton Barber**  and **Ronald Jones** continue to kill each others value and neither should be treated as more than RB3’s. Going up against one of the league's worst run defenses is a prime position to get a boom week out of one of these players, but it’s impossible to know who will get the volume to produce. **Dare Ogunbowale** isn’t seeing the field enough to be a fantasy asset, leave him on the wire.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Bengals couldn’t snag their first win in the participation trophy bowl last week, but it’s ok because Zac Taylor believes his team is all “going in the same direction”. Um, ok i guess. **Andy Dalton** did show signs of life in the 4th quarter, finishing with 262 yards and 2 TDs, but continues to be inconsistent and makes numerous mistakes every week. The Ravens have not been good on defense this year, and will be without CB Jimmy Smith again this week, but Dalton is no more than a bye week QB2 filler, albeit one in a projected shootout. **Tyler Boyd** gets a tough matchup against Humphrey, but his volume keeps him in the WR2 mix, especially in PPR leagues. **Auden Tate (upgrade)** should be the beneficiary with easier matchups, and he makes for a solid low end WR3 based on his usage the past few weeks. **Tyler Eifert (drop)** couldn’t get it going even against Arizona last week, so if you haven’t yet done him the courtesy of putting him back on the wire, do so now for his dignity as much as yours.


**RB Breakdown** 


In their first drive last week the Bengals ran almost every play, and their continuous chunk plays should have led to a TD. But after that drive, they struggled to generate any running lanes, and steadily gave up on the run game as the Cardinals jumped out to a lead. **Joe Mixon (downgrade PPR)** hit a season-high in rushing with 93 yards, but 60 of those were on the opening drive. He also turned his one target into a 16 yard catch. Mixon’s lack of involvement in the passing game is a big problem, as the Bengals will likely be in negative game flow for a majority of their remaining games. With the Bengals below-average offense not reaching the red zone very often, Mixon’s chances for rushing TD’s have decreased as well. If the Ravens get off to a good start, it’s easy to imagine Mixon finishing with around 75 rushing yards, no TD, and one catch for 10 yards again this week. That 8-10 point line is decent for an RB2, but makes for a risky start in PPR leagues, and isn’t the type of production owners that drafted Mixon early are counting on him for. Consider him a back end RB2 that needs to either get into the end zone or bust a big play in the passing game to have any chance at a ceiling game. **Gio Bernard (stash)** continues to out target Mixon, and has run more routes overall this season as well. He has no standalone value, but in the event of a Mixon injury, would potentially be a more valuable play than Mixon has been so far because of his likely 3 down role. He’s a valuable handcuff to roster at this point.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:**  Mark Ingram (65%, 21, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Ravens offense has cooled a bit in recent weeks, but they have still put up 23+ points in every game. **Lamar Jackson (upgrade)** has been a top-5 QB based mostly on his rushing ability, and he’s put in enough in the passing game to make him an every week set and forget. He’s no Pat Mahomes, but he’s also no Tim Tebow either. **Mark Andrews (upgrade)**  is tied for the highest target share on the team, and is an easy top-6 TE at an extremely thin position. The Cincy defense is 7th stingiest against TE’s (NFL.com) but Andrews will be a target hog this week, especially if the Ravens are missing their top WR. **Marquise Brown (downgrade PPR)**  is questionable to play after missing practice Wednesday and Thursday, so his status is worth monitoring closely heading into the weekend. If he does play, he makes for a solid WR3 because of his high target volume and big play ability, but may not be needed much if the Ravens pound the run at home. If he is forced to miss the game, **Willie Snead**  would enter the streaming radar as he has shown a solid connection with Jackson so far. Even as the top WR, however, he’d be no more than a WR4 with some decent PPR upside.


**RB Breakdown** 


The Ravens haven’t been quite as run heavy as some predicted, but **Mark Ingram (upgrade)**  has gotten just enough volume to be a top-10 RB so far this season. Going up against a defense that has given up the second most FPPG to opposing RB’s, and as a huge home favorite, Ingram makes for a top 5 RB play in Week 6. He’s a chalk play in DFS, and might be in a week-winning position on Sunday. ** Gus Edwards** and ** Justice Hill**  are no more than handcuffs for worried Ingram owners at this point.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Seahawks have managed to grind out a number of wins this year, and last week’s TNF matchup against the Rams was no exception. **Russell Wilson**  basically willed Seattle to victory, and he put on a clinic of efficient passing. He has yet to throw an INT this year, and is making an underwhelming cast of weapons look like a top-10 offense. Even against a solid pass defense that may get their starting CBs back this week, Wilson has been too good this year to consider benching. This does profile as one of the tougher matchups he’s faced this year, so expectations should be tempered slightly. **Tyler Lockett (downgrade)** is unlikely to face consistent coverage from either of the Browns young stud CBs (assuming they play) but his lack of volume of late (4 targets each of the last two weeks) make it harder to project a big week for him. The Browns have been much more vulnerable on the ground than through the air, so expect the overall passing volume to be lowered slightly. Lockett has really only had one big game all year, and it was against NO when the Seahawks were down big early. Assuming the Browns struggle again to put up points offensively, this doesn’t initially project as a game that should feature negative game script. **DK Metcalf (downgrade)** is the more likely WR to face some kind of shadow coverage on the outside, and combining that with his smaller target share, he’s more of a WR4 that you can only start in hopes of one long TD play. **Will Dissly (upgrade)** has been one of the surprises of the season with his strong play, and with the Browns giving up the 8th most FPPG to opposing TEs, he remains firmly planted in the top 8 of the position this week.


**RB Breakdown**


Despite some early fumbling issues, **Chris Carson (upgrade)** has been given a big workload in all but one game this year, and that was in a matchup that featured negative game flow right from the start (Week 3 vs. NO). Carson got 28 touches last week, and caught his only target for the go-ahead TD late in the game. The Browns are fresh off getting absolutely obliterated in the run game by the Niners and now go up against a Seattle team that runs the ball almost as much. Carson is a lock for 20+ touches, and has a great shot at a TD. He’s on the RB1/2 borderline, and just needs a slight uptick in targets to break into the top-12 ROS. **Rashaad Penny (stash)** isn’t garnering enough touches for standalone value, but remains an extremely valuable handcuff.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Nick Chubb (84%, 17, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


There’s no sugarcoating just how bad **Baker Mayfield (upgrade)** has been as a fantasy QB so far this year. He’s barely in the top-30 at the position through 5 weeks, and there’s just something wrong with this offense. This feels like a good game for Mayfield to put up a better line, and he may actually be available on the waiver wire this week. He’s nowhere near back to QB1 status, but going up against a burnable Seahawks secondary in a game the Browns could face some negative game script, Mayfield may surprise this week. We project him as a high end QB2, worth starting for owners in a bye week pinch. The biggest factor for Mayfield’s value is tied to getting **Odell Beckham Jr. (upgrade)** going for more than 2 catches. There are major concerns about OBJ’s fit in this offense with the lack of an offensive line meaning fewer downfield shots, but I think he gets going this week against Seattle. **Jarvis Landry** has only had one big week all year, but his floor in PPR remains usable because of his solid target share and low aDOT leading to high percentage looks. He’s a low upside WR3, and deserves to be bumped to WR4 range in standard leagues. His weekly 5-50 projection is usable, but not extremely exciting. **Antonio Callaway (downgrade)** didn’t move the needle much in his return, and isn’t a must own at this point because of the lack of downfield throwing in this offense.


**RB Breakdown**


One week after steamrolling the Ravens defense on the ground, **Nick Chubb** wasn’t able to get going in a blowout loss to the Niners last week. The volume is still there, and he’s a threat to take it to the house on any given play, so he needs to be in all lineups this week. A bigger role in the passing game would be a boon to his value, so hopefully Freddie Kitchens can find creative ways to get perhaps his most talented player the ball on Sunday.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Carlos Hyde (64%, 21, 1) Duke Johnson (40%, 10, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Last week’s fantasy bonanza against the Falcons featured a massive game from **Deshaun Watson (upgrade)**. KC has actually been stingy against QBs at home this year, but there’s no reason to view Watson as anything other than a top-3 QB play in the week’s highest projected scoring game. **DeAndre Hopkins** was unable to get in on the TD fun last week, but still finished with a respectable 88 yards on seven catches. He’s simply too talented to be held down for long, and has dusted more talented CBs than Breeland with ease over the years. He remains a top 10 WR play, and this is an ideal week for him to bust back onto the scene. **Will Fuller (upgrade)** went absolutely nuclear last week, and probably sent owners who benched him into therapy. There is no sure thing with a boom or bust player like Fuller, but in a shootout with Hopkins drawing likely shadow coverage, Fuller is set up beautifully to back up last week’s performance. He has to be in all lineups. **Keke Coutee** showed a little more last week, but is still only a stash at this point in case of injury to Hopkins or Fuller, not someone you can plug into your lineup.


**RB Breakdown**


This is one of the more frustrating backfields from a fantasy perspective, as either **Carlos Hyde (upgrade standard)** or **Duke Johnson** would be borderline RB1s if given a full workload, but neither is getting the volume necessary for big lines. Hyde is the better bet for a rushing TD, and is likely to get a solid volume of carries in the first half while the Texans try to keep Mahomes and company off the field. That plan could fall apart quickly, but Hyde’s floor is decent in standard leagues. DJ has drawn only 7 targets total over the past 3 weeks, and just isn’t getting the volume to be a worthwhile play. There is hope he’ll be used more in negative game script in a high scoring game, but it would take a major leap of faith to start him. Consider Hyde an RB2/3, with a bump in standard leagues, and Duke an RB4 with upside for a big play or two.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


There was some concern that **Patrick Mahomes** would be limited this week after injuring his ankle last week, but he has been clear that the issue won’t stop him from being at his best on Sunday. He’s an easy top-3 QB. **Tyreek Hill** may have an opportunity to return this week after logging two limited practices, so keep a close eye on his status heading into the weekend. Houston held up better than the stats showed against Matt Ryan last week, but would be absolutely no match for one of the better QB-WR duos in the league, assuming health. **Sammy Watkins** was a DNP on Thursday with a hammy issue, and his status looks to be a legitimate concern. If Hill is unable to return and Watkins can’t play, **Byron Pringle** would get in the mix in 3 wide sets next to **Demarcus Robinson** and **Mecole Hardman**. All three would be in play as WR3’s in this matchup if Hill and Watkins are out, but Robinson is probably the best bet if Hill or Watkins do play, considering his target share. **Travis Kelce (upgrade)** will need to step up in Watkins can’t play, so look for him to again have a big role and put up top-3 TE numbers.


**RB Breakdown**


One of the messier backfields so far this year surprisingly got a lot more clear when **Damien Williams** returned to the lineup last week. He immediately returned to starter status, receiving 12 touches to **Lesean McCoy’s** 2 touches, and **Darrel Williams’** 0 touches. Because Damien is used so frequently in the passing game, his floor should be that of a decent RB2, especially in PPR leagues. His ceiling in a projected shootout like this is top-10, so he should be in all lineups barring a late injury setback. McCoy could get a few more touches this week, but likely needs to be benched, and Darrel Williams becomes just a handcuff for Damien owners. Damien may just be able to pay off for patient owners who were able to survive his early season injury.

**Teddy ‘Checkdown’ Bridgewater** exploded last week against a poor Tampa secondary, throwing for 314 yards with 4 scores. Even with the breakout week, he’s no more than a 2QB league play or a one week streamer in good matchups. **Michael Thomas (upgrade)** has not slowed down in the absence of **Drew Brees** and it appears he’s a matchup proof WR1 moving forward, just keep in mind there may be some bumps along the way with Bridgewater at the controls. It appears that CB Jalen Ramsey is truly questionable to play (Jag’s owner Shahid Khan has said he’ll play, grain of salt), and his absence would be a huge upgrade to Thomas’ outlook. **Tre’Quan Smith (ankle)** was unable to return with an injury last week and **Ted Ginn** found his way into the endzone with a long score, but none of the peripheral pass catchers should be considered. **Jared Cook** finally showed up, posting 4-41-1 last week. He can be considered a low-end TE1 in a mediocre matchup, just remember his floor is scary low. 


**RB Breakdown**


**Alvin Kamara** has popped up on the injury report late in the week which is never a good sign. He’s fully expected to play, but owners should grab **Latavius Murray** as an insurance policy. The matchup for the Saints running game is as optimal as they come, Jacksonville ranks dead last in Run DVOA and is giving up 23.1 FPPG to running backs.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Rookie mistakes cost **Gardner Minshew (upgrade)** last week as he lost 3 fumbles, but he still gave his team a chance to win in a back and forth battle with the Panthers. Minshew has been as consistent as they come at the QB position, he has averaged 17.8 FPPG and has yet to score less than 16 fantasy points since taking over as the starter. If Minshew puts up a big week against a solid NO defense, he will likely be impossible to keep out of lineups. Consider him a back-end QB1 against the Saints middle of the road defense - they are giving up 23.7 FPPG to quarterbacks, third worst. **D.J. Chark** continued his impressive breakout, showing out with 8-164-2 last week. He can’t be denied a spot in your lineup due to upside, even with a date against Marshon Lattimore who just held Mike Evans to a goose egg, consider him a WR2 this week. Another good week and he may be pushing into the WR1 ranks. If Lattimore does indeed shadow Chark, then **Dede Westbrook** would draw the better matchup, going against SCB P.J. Williams. Consider him an upside WR3. **Chris Conley** isn’t seeing enough volume to be a consistent option in fantasy and is best left on the wire. The Saints secondary has been exploitable this season, giving up 28.6 FPPG to wideouts. Continue to fade Jacksonville’s tight ends, but keep an eye on Geoff Swaim. He may assume some volume with fellow tight end James O’Shaughnessy announced out for the year with an ACL tear.    


**RB Breakdown**


**Leonard Fournette** has received the second most touches (115) so far this season, only behind superhuman Christian McCaffery (136). The matchup on paper isn’t ideal, NO is only giving up 14 FPPG to running backs. However, Fournette’s volume provides him a safe floor and he should be in all lineups.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The most valuable player to the Eagles last week was wearing a Jets jersey, and his name is Luke Falk. He allowed the Eagles D to turn two mistakes into TDs, and was unable to put anything together on offense. This meant that none of the Philly weapons on offense needed to do much to win, so **Carson Wentz** ended with a slightly disappointing day. His matchup this week is significantly tougher against a defense that has given up the 8th fewest FPPG to opposing QBs and ranks as a top 10 defense in both pass and run DVOA. He is still a solid QB1 option. **Alshon Jeffery (upgrade standard)** is back to full health and this week goes up against Xavier Rhodes, who has been burned by Jeffery in past matchups (Rotoworld). This isn’t a shy away matchup for either Wentz or Jeffery, and because the Eagles have a strong run defense, the Vikings strategy to control the game on the ground may not be as successful. This feels like a game where Jeffery hits the end zone. **Zach Ertz** remains a reliable weekly top-3 TE due to target share and his connection with Wentz is in fine form. **Nelson Agholor (drop)** likely only has one week left of receiving a decent target share with DJax possibly returning next week, so he can be dropped for someone with better ROS outlook. He has the potential to sneak into the endzone this week, but his floor is that of a 0 catch 0 yard performance. Wentz is a back end QB1 this week, and Jeffery is right on the edge of a top-20 ranking at WR.


**RB Breakdown**


The Eagles have employed an RBBC so far this year, and in Week 5 found the split between **Jordan Howard (downgrade PPR)** and **Miles Sanders** to be almost exactly equal. Howard is getting the more valuable redzone carries, so his TD upside put his at the back end of the RB2 rankings. Sanders hasn’t been extremely efficient with his carries, and isn’t being used in the passing game as much as some had projected, but his four catches in Week 5 were encouraging. Coach Doug Pederson has said the Eagles will continue to ride the hot hand, and that appears to be Howard at the moment. Both can be used in the flex spot, but Howard is a safer option because of his tendency to end up in the end zone the past weeks (5 in last 3 games).

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Vikings passing game finally got up and running a bit last week, and **Kirk Cousins (upgrade)** finished with his best game of the season. On paper, this looks like a matchup to exploit through the air, as the Eagles are much more vulnerable there than on the ground, but it remains to be seen if OC Kevin Stefanski will adjust his gameplan at all. Cousins can be looked at in 2QB leagues, but still isn’t sniffing QB1 status until we see a consistent uptick in passing volume. He makes for an intriguing streamer this week, however. **Adam Thielen** has been Cousins’ preferred target the past few weeks, and has gotten his target share up close to 25%. While he still isn’t producing like the WR1 he was drafted to be, this week again sets up well for him to put up solid numbers. He should be in all lineups and can be counted on for WR2 numbers. **Stefon Diggs (upgrade)** is a slightly more risky proposition. He currently has a smaller target share than his starting RB, and has only one game over 50 yards receiving. While it’s tough to bench a player of Diggs’ talent, owners are likely extremely frustrated with his production so far. This feels like a get right matchup against the Eagles burnable secondary so we recommend you start him universally. Keep the faith for this week. **Kyle Rudolph (drop)** currently has a lower target share than his backup **Irv Smith** which tells the story of his fantasy irrelevance. If you’ve been holding this long, it’s time to let go.


**RB Breakdown**


Even in an extremely tough matchup this week, **Dalvin Cook** remains a top-3 RB play in all formats. He has shown his floor even in a game the Vikings are losing (Week 4 vs. CHI) to be 15+ points, so he is a clear auto-start. There may be some efficiency struggles on the ground due to Philly’s stout front seven, but he will bust at least one big play, and his involvement in the passing game keeps him elite even in the event the Eagles get out to a big lead. **Alexander Mattison (stash)** remains one of the league’s best handcuffs, so he should be universally owned. If you own Mattison but not Cook, consider seeing what you can pry from the Cook owner over the next few weeks.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Chris Thompson (54%, 9, 7) Adrian Peterson (27%, 7, 0) Wendall Smallwood (19%, 6, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Interim coach Bill Callahan has yet to name a starter at quarterback, but all indications point to **Case Keenum** being under center this week. He’s not an option in fantasy, but his return is great news for **Terry McLaurin** who seems to be recovered from a hamstring injury. The bad news is that ‘F1’ McLaurin will be facing off against the Dolphins best player, CB Xavien Howard. Nevertheless, McLaurin has earned must start status as a WR2 and he’ll be facing the worst defense in the NFL. Fire him up. **Paul Richardson** with a healthy McLaurin is too much of a question mark to see lineups even in the dream matchup. **Vernon Davis** is still making his way back from a concussion and it’s unclear if he will play. **Jeremy Sprinkle** and **Jerome Cunningham** will take over again if he is absent, but neither are recommended plays. 
 

**RB Breakdown**


Owners probably scooped up **Adrian Peterson (upgrade)** after the news broke that interim coach Callahan thinks that not running the ball enough is Washington's main issue (it’s not). He’s got a dream matchup on deck and should be considered a RB2/3, his floor remains scary low but it seems more likely than not that he finds pay dirt in Week 6’s poop fest. **Chris Thompson (upgrade PPR)** continues to produce in PPR, putting up a consistent 11.7 FPPG. Thompson can be considered a back-end RB2 with an upgrade in PPR formats. This game seems like it could go either way in terms of being high scoring or low scoring, so all options are a bit risky. 


#**Dolphins**


**Opp (WSH) Pass DVOA:** #28


**Opp (WSH) Run DVOA:** #18


**Injuries to Watch DEF (WSH):** LB Josh Harvey-Clemons (Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (MIA):** None


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Preston Williams (22%) DeVante Parker (18%) Kenyan Drake (15%) Jakeem Grant (14%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 4:** Kenyan Drake (57%, 15, 6) Mark Walton (27%, 8, 2) Kalen Ballage (16%, 2, 1)  


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Miami from an offense standpoint, and just an overall football standpoint, have been awful. Remember that when Vegas favors a home team by 3 points, that’s essentially saying that both teams are completely even. **Josh Rosen** isn’t a fantasy option. **Preston Williams** and **Devante Parker** can be considered this week going against Washington's dreadful secondary, but really you probably have a better option at receiver. Even in the best matchup of the year, all Miami players are an extreme risk. Put your money on teams that you know can move the ball. **Albert Wilson** is an intriguing DFS play against a defense that has allowed the fourth-most PPR per game to slow WRs this season (per Sports Info Solutions and Rotoworld). Don’t play a Miami tight end, you know better. 


**RB Breakdown**


The running back rotation for Miami is an absolute mess and no running back has produced enough to see fantasy lineups. After a mistake filled start to the season, it appears that **Kalen Ballage** has fallen out of favor for rookie **Mark Walton**. If there were a surefire week to start **Kenyan Drake**, it seems like it would be this week. However, the Dolphins have been so putrid it seems like more risk than it’s worth. Fade the Dolphins backfield where possible.

How to kick someone out of NFL Fantasy League?,"Hey everyone, so we recently had a guy in our league just completely self-destruct and it's kind of ruining the experience and integrity of the game for the rest of us. This person accidentally dropped Tyler Lockett and put out a claim that ""if anyone picks him up, I'll never play again"". Well, of course, someone put in a waiver claim and we basically told him ""talk to the commissioner to fix it"". His response was to drop everyone on his own team. What's worse is he's still in the NFL discussions tab writing trolling comments to everyone.

The commissioner is super busy with family and has barely put any effort into making sure there's a fair outcome for everyone. Other players are upset that, as it stands right now, anyone who faces that player just receives an auto-win for the week.

Any advice I can pass onto the commissioner would be greatly appreciated!",89,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgic6p/how_to_kick_someone_out_of_nfl_fantasy_league/,5040.800307218234,r/fantasyfootball

Buy low with Air Yards: Week 5,"Hey all! I'm back to share Air Yards and Air Yards Opportunity Delta leaders for week 5!

**What are Air Yards?**

Air yards measures the sum of the depths of all of a receiver's targets.

**What is Air Yards Opportunity Delta?**

Opportunity Delta is the difference between a receiver's **air yards** and their **actual yardage.** In Josh Hermsmeyer's words, ""We can use air yards to help us unearth which receivers the quarterback and coaches would like to see get the ball—knowing that has predictive value.""

**Why should I care?**

This metric shows which receivers could stand the most to improve given their current opportunity. Perhaps their QB can't get on the same page as them. Maybe they just had a bad matchup or bad luck. But receivers on this list are getting lots of targets and opportunities, which generally correlates well with performance.

This data is available freely at Josh's website [airyards.com](https://airyards.com/). I've decided to compile a top-15 list of receivers by both Opportunity Delta as well as air yards. Enjoy!

"With a bunch of players in concussion protocol recently (Shep, Mason, Hock, etc) I felt this article is good for people to understand how it works and how to estimate your players coming back into a game","https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/9/18/12940926/nfl-concussion-protocol-explained

>**Return to play process**

>In addition to the in-game protocol, there is also a ""Return-to-Participation Protocol"" that can keep players out of action for more practices or games until they pass through and are cleared to return.

>It is a five-step process without any set timeline for a full return from a concussion:

>1) Rest and recovery: Until a player returns to the ""baseline level of signs and symptoms and neurological examination,"" only limited stretching and balance activities are recommended. Electronics, social media and team meetings are all to be avoided.

>2) Light aerobic exercise: The NFL recommends 10-20 minutes on a stationary bike or treadmill without resistance training or weight training. The cardiovascular activity is monitored by an athletic trainer to ""determine if there are any recurrent concussion signs or symptoms.""

>3) Continued aerobic exercise and introduction of strength training: Increased duration and intensity of aerobic exercise with strength training added. An athletic trainer will supervise to watch for recurrent concussions signs or symptoms.

>4) Football specific activities: The cognitive load of playing football will be added and players will participate in non-contact activities for the typical duration of a full practice.

>5) Full football activity/clearance: A player returns to full participation in practice, including contact without restriction.

Using a current example of Hock with the latest tweet coming from this excerpt: [A little T.J. Hockenson update from Matt Patricia: Hockenson is doing everything in practice. Still has one more day of doing that, then being re-checked by doctors before he's out of concussion protocol. Brain injuries are unpredictable, but Hockenson trending towards playing](https://twitter.com/davebirkett/status/1182679061799276545?s=21), there's a good chance from this tweet that Hock is currently in step 4 of the process and now needs to pass one last exam.  Hock owners should feel pretty good about this since with a Monday game, it gives Hock an extra day of rest and hopefully will allow him to exit protocol to be ready for the game.

Michel owners: My take as a lifelong Pats fan on why you should be encouraged by Michel going forward.,"TLDR: It's not all on Sony, we can't run him outside because we lost our ability to seal the edge and considering our troubles at WR, teams just pack the box against Sony. With the right pieces in place he will get better. He's a mid/low RB2 now with the potential to be low RB1, but hes not the RB4 and bench rider everyone is making him out to be.

I'm not an expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt and feel free to correct me or add where needed but this is just my opinion on watching close to every Pats game over the past 20 years.

I can't say it's really his fault. Losing Gronk was a much bigger deal than just his catch and target contribution. Gronk was an excellent blocker and was able to seal the edge which allowed our RBs to get to the outside. Frankly put, Izzo and Lacoste are just not good blockers. Now, Michel has always kind of been a North/South runner, but now we can't even fool the other team into thinking we can run outside. Most of our outside runs with Michel are just screen passes (since we can't seal the edge) where the WRs just jam the line but that is also painfully obvious to other teams once he is in motion or split out. Our desperation at our inability to be able to get outside is shown on the quick passes to Sony (who isn't really regarded as a good pass catcher but we have no choice to try to get him outside somehow).

I anticipate Bill will make some sort of acquisition to make this happen or retrain another position to be able to get there to seal the edge. We already have a compromised WR squad, leaving ourselves with up the gut runs as our only option is a huge vulnerability that I can't see Bill leaving open. I think if you had to chose one or the other, it's easier to retrain a player to seal it (or cheaper to acquire a TE who can) than it is to find a competent WR who can learn our playbook and system mid-season.

Oh, also, Develin (our awesome FB!) is out, so even his up the guts will struggle. Sony has his faults, mainly an inability to break tackles and reliance on the North South runs, but I would be encouraged by a 113yard stat line given the things that are holding him back currently",215,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dggpqc/michel_owners_my_take_as_a_lifelong_pats_fan_on/,5161.433641215165,r/fantasyfootball

Who are some good WR's with potential to target for trades before the deadline?,"Who are some people that aren't 100% owned, that you think have potential in the second half of the fantasy season, to become contributors/starters, on a WR weak team?

I for instance have been targeting Gallup... unfortunately he has an amazing week last week, so he's over 90% owned now.  Desean jackson is also another name that comes to mind, but I personally(as an eagles fan) am fearing that he might not even come back during this fantasy season.

Is Dontrell Hilliard the real Handcuff for Chubb?,"I know that everyone is sick of the Kareem Hunt posts, trust me I am too.

I've been wondering though, does anyone get the sense that Hilliard is going to be the true handcuff for Chubb and be the main beneficiary if something happened to Chubb even after week 9? I did a little digging and did see a research paper indicating that sports hernias do have a very good return to sport % with minimal to no reduction in performance, however it did indicate that its likely for the player sustaining on to have a shorter athletic career.

Hilliard also has been pretty solid when hes been given the ball this season and had solid stats in preseason. Hunt didn't exactly look as good in preseason. (editted this, where I was looking to find Hilliards stats for whatever reason didn't show for preseason rushing but going to the nfl page I saw his numbers looked decent).

I realize its a bit of speculation, I'm just curious if anyone has a conviction one way or the other on this. Hunt receives all the attention but is it reasonable to think given the time off the field, the injury, and the performance of Hilliard that Hunt's value is even less than it already is?",18,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgg920/is_dontrell_hilliard_the_real_handcuff_for_chubb/,5195.200308048725,r/fantasyfootball

Jakobi Meyers Value,"What's everyones take on Jakobi Meyers. He filled in as the Patriots WR3 last night after Gordon exited. He had a pretty decent game, 4 targets and 4 receptions. Is he worth a pickup from the waiver wire, or is it best to take a chance on someone else.",17,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgeyg1/jakobi_meyers_value/,5294.166975017389,r/fantasyfootball
Disrespect to GT3? ROS?,"https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player-news/9285001

Essentially the Giants' only weapon, Tate typically found himself glued to a Patriots defender, but he managed a number of tough catches versus tight coverage. That was the case against Jonathan Jones on Tate's 64-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Although he's still feisty, Tate is not the playmaker he once was. He figures to settle in as a low-end WR4 once Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard and Evan Engram can get back on the field.


This man went 6/102/1. Against the pats. Most of the time in double coverage. I understand he was essentially the only weapon last night but his blurb seems pretty incorrect to me. He has lead in YAC for years in a row. He wasnt even utilized correctly last night with his YAC ability. 


How do you see him moving forward?",42,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgewjr/disrespect_to_gt3_ros/,5298.233642133077,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Simple Questions and League Issues] - Fri Morning, 10/11/2019","**DO NOT post Who Do I Start, Add Drop, or Trade questions in this thread; find the appropriate thread within the [INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day).**

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

How to handle your studs not practicing,"This is mostly for ""newer"" fantasy players, or those who haven't own guys like Julio in the past.

In most cases, when you see the ""Q"" next to a players name, don't scramble. Especially on Thursdays, veterans don't practice if they have some minor injury (contusion, pain). They take it easy, study up, and get ready for Sunday/Monday. Don't scramble to pickup a backup, don't drop a decent bench player because you are afraid your star won't play- the fact of the matter is ""Questionable"" is, about 80% of the time, just a way of saying that player is making sure they're close to 100% for their game.

Obviously this isn't always true, and if you're stud (thinking Tyreek here) is questionable coming out of an injury, sometimes teams play it safe, but for the most part, Q isn't as scary as it seems.",21,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg6sx8/how_to_handle_your_studs_not_practicing/,6087.200309367975,r/fantasyfootball

What would be the changes in gamescript for both the bucs and panthers in their 2nd meetup?,"This game has at least 8 players who have the potential to finish in the  20 of their position this week in Winston, Evans, Godwin (would include OJ Howard), Ronald Jones , McCafrey ,Olsen, DJ Moore, and Samuel but the last game in week 2  was kind of a bust for all those players outside of Godwin, Olsen and Curtis Sam. How do you guys think each team will adjust and which player has an has an increase/decrease in fantasy performance compared to their week 2 meeting?   Obv your not sitting the #1 guy in FF, but do you think bucs keep CMC in check again?  can Kyle Allen manage this game better than Cam did 2 weeks ago?",24,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg6lap/what_would_be_the_changes_in_gamescript_for_both/,6104.016976133982,r/fantasyfootball

"For those hurting badly at WR this week, consider Devante Parker.","I know, I know...hear me out. He’s averaging 6 targets per game and over 20 air yards per target. 4/70 and a TD week 4 against the Chargers. 2 of 4 games played over 70 yards. I don’t need to tell you how badly the Redskins suck. They’re allowing completions on almost 77%(!) of WR targets this year. On 6 targets with 20 air yds/target, we’re looking at 4/80 or 5/100 with a decent TD chance extrapolated out. I hear a lot of Preston Williams hype, but I think you could do a lot worse than Parker this week in deep leagues. Great cheap DFS dart throw as well.",50,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg65v9/for_those_hurting_badly_at_wr_this_week_consider/,6138.133642919858,r/fantasyfootball

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team’s matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you’re in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‘Em game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn’t give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

The Scary Terry,"Hey all Terry Mclauren owners, just had a few questions ab Terry’s production this week. 

Quick reminder : As the redskins are playing a terrible dolphins team, if you own terry you start him. If not, you do not deserve the man. 


Now onto the questions/Thoughts 

-Does not having Keemun affect terry’s targets/production? (I haven’t heard of reports of the QB situation) I know he has the connection with Haskins, but even then he wasn’t Haskins #1 target. 

-With the firing of Gruden, does this affect the production of terry whatsoever? Is the intern head coach run heavy? 

-Finally, so just came out and said it was the best practice they have had all season, showing hope for them to get on track, boosting Terry’s value?

Regardless of what happens, I will forever be staring the man of the year, Scary Terry.",35,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg62w9/the_scary_terry/,6144.350309797128,r/fantasyfootball

Rookie Report: Week 6 Starts & Sits,"**Drinkfive Rookie Report: Week 6**

&nbsp;

Welcome back to the Rookie Report! We’re another week deeper into the season and finally starting to get into the bye weeks where things can get a little dicey for your squads if you don’t have great depth. I wouldn’t expect to find much running back help from the rookie crop this week with David Montgomery, Josh Jacobs and Devin Singletary all on byes. Jacobs did put on a show across the pond on Sunday though. Week 5 also saw Kyler Murray get his first win, saw DK Metcalf and Marquise Brown each get back in the end zone, and saw another outstanding performance from Gardner Minshew albeit in a loss. The rookie running backs might have a bleak outlook this week, but there are plenty of other rookies to talk about. Let’s talk about what we can look forward to in week 6 from the rookie crop…

&nbsp;

**Rookies to Start:** 

&nbsp;

**QB Kyler Murray, ARI (Wk. 6: vs. Atl.):** The Falcons’ defense has really struggled this year, especially since Keanu Neal went down late in the first half of their week 3 game. They rank 30th in Football Outsiders’ pass defense DVOA stat and in the last 3 weeks they’ve allowed 963 passing yards and a 10:0 TD to INT ratio. They also allowed Marcus Mariota and Deshaun Watson to combine for 69 rushing yards (nice) in the last 2 weeks. Murray has started to use his legs as an asset, racking up 189 yards and 2 scores on the ground in his last 3 games. He may also get Christian Kirk back this week. The TDs will eventually come for Kyler. The Cardinals are tied for 4th in the NFL with an average of 4 red zone trips per game. I expect Murray to be a top-8 QB this week.

&nbsp;

**WR Terry McLaurin, WAS (Wk. 6: @Mia.):** Don’t be concerned about the coaching change in Washington when it comes to McLaurin. Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan is the guy taking over, so things shouldn’t change much. Former head coach Jay Gruden had a lot of control over the offense previously, so I would expect Callahan to put his own wrinkles in (most notably he’s talked about wanting to run more), but it should remain largely the same offense. The better news for McLaurin this week is that he should get Case Keenum back at QB. Keenum is much more willing to throw downfield than Colt McCoy. McLaurin also goes from facing the best defense in the league to one of the worst. Miami has been shredded by opposing WR1s so far, so McLaurin should be a safe WR3 in your lineups this week. 

&nbsp;

**WR Marquise Brown, BAL (Wk. 6: vs. Cin.):** Keep an eye on the injury report this week. Head coach John Harbaugh said Brown’s injury is nothing serious, but he isn’t practicing yet as of Thursday. If he does play and it sounds like he’ll be close to 100%, get him in your lineup. The Bengals rank 31st in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 3rd-highest yards per attempt in the league to opposing passing attacks. Baltimore has an implied total of 29.5 points, so there should be plenty of offense for them in this one. Other deep threat receivers have fared well against Cincy. DK Metcalf posted 4-89, Marquise Goodwin went 3-77-1, and they also allowed long scores to Diontae Johnson and Tyler Lockett this year. Brown shouldn’t be on your bench unless the injury keeps him there.

&nbsp;

**Borderline Rookies:** 

&nbsp;

**QB Gardner Minshew, JAX (Wk. 6: vs. NO):** I keep telling you to sit Minshew each week, and he keeps responding by making me look foolish. He’s continued to turn what look like limited upside matchups into efficient and strong QB2 performances. This week he has a matchup that actually does have some upside for him. Naturally, he’s going to inevitably lay an egg in the week that he should blow up because fantasy football likes to laugh at us, but this looks like a spot where he is a reasonable bye week fill-in and a must-start in 2QB formats. The Saints rank 20th in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 5th-most points per game to opposing QBs on the year. 4 of the 5 QBs they’ve faced topped 20 fantasy points. Minshew is an interesting option in DFS cash games this week that could allow you to spend your money on the other positions. He’s the 25th-highest priced QB on DraftKings ($5,000) but has yet to finish worse than the QB16 in any week this year.

&nbsp;

**WR Mecole Hardman, KC (Wk. 6: vs. Hou.):** I’d lean toward starting Mecole this week if you’ve got him, especially if Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins both sit out. As of Wednesday, it sounds like Hill will be a game-time call, and Watkins is probably on the wrong side of questionable. Houston has allowed the 9th-most WR points per game on the year and the Chiefs have an implied total of 30 points. If Watkins and Hill both sit, 3-wide sets will consist of Hardman, Demarcus Robinson, and Byron Pringle. All 3 would have upside in this matchup, but I’d prefer Hardman over the other two. The return of Hill or Watkins would push him down to more of a WR4 this week.

&nbsp;

**WR Preston Williams, MIA (Wk. 6: vs. Was.):** It feels awkward calling any Dolphin even as much as a borderline fantasy play, but Preston fits the bill this week. Washington has allowed the 3rd-most WR points per game, and Williams has been the target on nearly a quarter of Josh Rosen’s pass attempts this season. Rosen being named the starter for the remainder of the year is unquestionably a positive thing for Williams’ fantasy outlook. Preston has topped 10 PPR points in 3 out his 4 games this year, and he did that against tougher opponents than Washington. Williams is a reasonable WR3/flex option if you’re dealing with injuries or byes at the position this week.

&nbsp;

**WR DK Metcalf, SEA (Wk. 6: @Cle.):** Metcalf’s deep ball upside keeps him in play as a WR3/flex option, but this might not be the best week for him. The Browns have had a conservative approach on the back end of the defense, taking away the deep ball and letting teams beat them underneath. They’ve allowed just 12 passes of 20+ yards though 5 games. It only takes one big play for Metcalf but be aware that he’s a volatile option.

&nbsp;

**Rookies to Sit:** 

&nbsp;

**QB Daniel Jones, NYG (Wk. 6: @NE):** Jones posted his worst start of the year in week 5, and things look unlikely to get much better this week. Saquon Barkley, Evan Engram, Sterling Shepard and Wayne Gallman have all been ruled out already for Thursday night’s game and the Giants have an implied total below 14 points. The Patriots rank 2nd in pass defense DVOA and haven’t allowed at TD pass all year. They also have 11 interceptions through 5 games. This is the worst possible spot to start Jones.

&nbsp;

**QB Devlin Hodges, PIT (Wk. 6: @LAC):** Hodges came into last Sunday’s game against the Ravens after an Earl Thomas hit knocked Mason Rudolph out cold, and he appears likely to get the starting nod this week. He didn’t look completely lost in his first NFL action, completing 7 of 9 passes for 68 yards and adding a 20-yard run, but there were some other incompletions (including an INT) that were negated by penalties. It would be a huge gamble to roll the dice on the undrafted rookie this week. The Chargers rank just 25th in pass defense DVOA, but only Deshaun Watson has reached 20 fantasy points against them. The Steelers are likely to go with as run-heavy a game plan as they can this week.

&nbsp;

**QB Dwayne Haskins, WAS (Wk. 6: @Mia.):** Bill Callahan made it clear after taking over as the new head coach that he shares Jay Gruden’s outlook for Haskins: they don’t want him starting right now. Callahan said Haskins may be inactive some weeks with Keenum and McCoy both healthy. There is no reason to hold onto Haskins in redraft leagues right now.

&nbsp;

**RB Miles Sanders, PHI (Wk. 6: @Min.):** Sanders is a really dicey flex option this week after comments from Doug Pederson that Jordan Howard will get more carries going forward. Howard has been a more decisive runner and has taken advantage of the Eagles’ mauling offensive line more effectively than Sanders has. The rookie may have a saving grace this week with Darren Sproles sidelined. It should be Sanders working as the primary receiving back this week (unless Corey Clement pops up). The problem is that Minnesota has allowed the 2nd-fewest RB receptions and receiving yards per game. I’d avoid playing Sanders this week unless you have to. Even if he still sees ok rushing volume, the Vikings rank 2nd in run defense DVOA.

&nbsp;

**RB Tony Pollard, DAL (Wk. 6: @NYJ):** There is a chance that Pollard actually has a nice week at the Meadowlands. Pollard averaged 11 touches per game in the Cowboys’ 3 easy wins to open the year, and then played just 7 combined offensive snaps in the two losses since. The Cowboys are a touchdown favorite on Sunday, so Pollard may get involved late. The reason I list him as a ‘rookie to sit’ is because the Jets do have a decent run defense (11th in run defense DVOA) and I really don’t know what kind of league I would be desperate enough to play him in. 

&nbsp;

**RB Alexander Mattison, MIN (Wk. 6: vs. Phi.):** Mattison continued his trend of flashing in games with positive game script in week 5. He’s averaged 53 scrimmage yards per game in the Vikings’ 3 wins and just 19 yards in their 2 losses. Minnesota is a 3-point favorite this week, but I wouldn’t be looking for another 50-yard day out of Mattison. The Eagles have wiped out opposing running games, allowing less than 50 rushing yards per game to opposing backfields. Dalvin Cook might struggle to get to 50 yards on the ground in this one. I don’t expect there to be much left over for the rookie.

&nbsp;

**RB Justice Hill, BAL (Wk. 6: vs. Cin.):** The matchup in week 6 is a juicy one for Baltimore’s backfield. The Bengals allow the 2nd-most RB points per game and rank 26th in run defense DVOA, but Hill has been an afterthought in this offense. He played the fewest snaps that he has all year in week 5. His DraftKings price tag is just $3,200, so you could roll the dice on him getting some extended run in a GPP tournament if you’re feeling feisty, but Gus Edwards is likely the biggest benefactor if the Ravens win in a rout.

&nbsp;

**RB Ryquell Armstead, JAX (Wk. 6: vs. NO):** Armstead followed up a strong performance in week 4 with a disappearing act in week 5. He’s got 12 touches on the year, and 9 of them were in that week 4 contest. He’s no more than a Leonard Fournette handcuff at this point with next to no standalone value.

&nbsp;

**RB Dexter Williams, GB (Wk. 6: vs. Det.):** Dexter seemed to have a prime opportunity to step up last weekend with Jamaal Williams sidelined. Instead the Packers activated Tra Carson from their practice squad and let him serve as the #2 back. Apparently, Dexter’s pass blocking isn’t where it needs to be for the Packers to trust him on the field. There isn’t any reason to have him rostered in redraft formats.

&nbsp;

**WR Diontae Johnson, PIT (Wk. 6: @LAC):** Johnson has had a healthy target share for the Steelers since Big Ben went down and the Chargers are in the middle of the pack when it comes to points allowed to WRs, but Devlin Hodges at QB means I’m not willing to trust Diontae in lineups this week, even with James Washington sidelined. Johnson also needs to fix his ball control issues going forward. He’s fumbled twice in as many weeks, and his playing time will start to go down if that continues.

&nbsp;

**WR Miles Boykin, BAL (Wk. 6: vs. Cin.):** Boykin gets a decent matchup against the Bengals this week. As I mentioned with Hollywood Brown earlier, they rank 31st in pass defense DVOA, and the Ravens have an implied team total of just under 30 points. Unfortunately for Boykin, he’s settled in as a guy playing right around 30% of the offensive snaps each week. That just isn’t enough playing time to trust him even in good matchups. This isn’t a bad week to hope he finds the end zone, but that’s really as much as you can hope for here unless Brown misses this game. If Brown is out, Boykin should get a little additional run but is still more of a dart throw than reliable option.

&nbsp;

**WR Andy Isabella, ARI (Wk. 6: vs. Atl.):** Kliff Kingsbury stayed mostly true to his word last weekend and didn’t move Andy Isabella into the slot to replace Christian Kirk. Instead he used a rotation of Pharoh Cooper and his 2 tight ends (Maxx Williams & Charles Clay). Isabella did see a season-high 10 snaps, but he wasn’t targeted at all. He did get 2 rushing attempts. It sounds like Kirk will return this week, but even if he doesn’t, Isabella isn’t a guy to consider.

&nbsp;

**TE Irv Smith, MIN (Wk. 6: vs. Phi.):** Smith played 51% of the Vikings’ offensive snaps last week…and wasn’t targeted even once. There will be weeks where the ball comes his way, but those weeks will be hard to predict in this low volume passing offense.

&nbsp;

**TE TJ Hockenson, DET (Wk. 6: @GB):** The fact that the Lions had to come out after Hockenson’s concussion and say that he won’t be put on IR doesn’t make it sound like he’ll be back right away. Stunningly he was back at practice Wednesday & Thursday, but he is still in the concussion protocol. It seems like he’s trending in the right direction, but he could end up a game-time decision and the Packers have allowed the 6th-fewest tight end points per game this year. Since Hock plays on Monday, there really won’t be a way to have backup plan if Hockenson sits at the last minute. You’d basically be choosing between Jesse James and Robert Tonyan in that scenario (unless you have Jimmy Graham). I’d much rather just play someone else rather than wait on Hockenson in a tougher matchup.

&nbsp;

**Rookies on Byes: RB David Montgomery, CHI, RB Josh Jacobs, OAK, RB Devin Singletary, BUF, WR Hunter Renfrow, OAK, WR Parris Campbell, IND, TE Dawson Knox, BUF, TE Foster Moreau, OAK**

&nbsp;

**Deep League Sleepers, Stashes, and Cheap DFS Options:** 

&nbsp;

**RB Jon Hilliman, NYG (Wk. 6: @NE):** With Gallman and Barkley ruled out, Hilliman is the default starting running back for the Giants this week. He doesn’t get an inviting matchup. The Patriots haven’t let any running back get into the end zone this year, and they allow the 2nd-fewest RB fantasy points per game and rank 3rd in run defense DVOA. With the game script expected to be very negative for the Giants, Hilliman will have to do work in the passing game to return a decent day. He did catch 36 passes in his last 2 college seasons despite not being a workhorse back, so he may not be a slouch as a receiver. I wouldn’t be too interested in him in redraft leagues, especially with Saquon looking like he’ll return next week, but a $3,200 price tag in DraftKings for a starting running back is at least intriguing in a GPP tournament. 

&nbsp;

**RB Benny Snell, PIT (Wk. 6: @LAC):** The Steelers only face one defense ranked higher than 23rd in run defense DVOA in their next 7 games, and Jaylen Samuels is out for a month. Samuels had been mixing in behind Conner a decent amount, and while Snell isn’t nearly as versatile as Jaylen, the Steelers are very likely to focus on running the football while Devlin Hodges is at QB. Snell should work as a change of pace back behind Conner for the coming weeks and is worth scooping up in deeper formats.

&nbsp;

**RB Reggie Bonnafon, CAR (Wk. 6: @TB):** For some inexplicable reason Jordan Scarlett is the highest priced rookie running back on DraftKings this week ($4,300) despite playing just 5 offensive snaps on the season. Anyone paying attention knows Bonnafon is the handcuff back here. Bonnafon played 11 snaps last weekend when Christian McCaffrey was dealing with cramps and he turned in a 5-80-1 line. I don’t suggest using Bonnafon this week as the Bucs rank #1 in the league in run defense DVOA. Bonnafon is worth scooping up as insurance in deep leagues if you have CMC.

&nbsp;

**WR AJ Brown, TEN (Wk. 6: @Den.):** Brown has been the epitome of boom or bust this season. He’s has more PPR points in each of his two ‘boom’ games than he does in the other 3 combined. Chris Harris Jr. is likely to shadow Corey Davis this week, which should benefit Brown. Other notable number one receivers who have faced the Broncos include Allen Robinson (4-41), Davante Adams (4-56), DJ Chark (4-44) and Keenan Allen (4-18). Number 2 receivers have fared better – Marquez Valdes-Scantling (6-99-1), Dede Westbrook (5-66) and Mike Williams (6-74). Brown is in play this week in deep leagues and in DFS tournaments.

&nbsp;

**WR Deebo Samuel, SF (Wk. 6: @LAR):** The 49ers have had one of the toughest WR groups to figure out for fantasy purposes. None of them were useful on Monday night as they blew the doors off the Browns. No receiver had more than 4 targets. This week’s game projects as more of a shootout with an over/under of 50. The 49ers should be forced to throw a little more, and the Rams rank 24th in pass defense DVOA. San Francisco has tried to manufacture ways to get the ball into Deebo’s hands, so he’s the 49er receiver I’d be most likely to take a shot on having a big game this week.

&nbsp;

**WR KeeSean Johnson, ARI (Wk. 6: vs. Atl.):** Johnson was basically a full-time player in week 5 with Christian Kirk out. Kirk might be out again this week, and Johnson was targeted 7 times in his absence on Sunday. The Falcons allow the 2nd-most WR points per game, so there is legitimate upside for KeeSean this week if Kirk sits again.

&nbsp;

**WR Jakobi Meyers, NE (Wk. 6: vs. NYG):** With Phillip Dorsett sidelined, Meyers will step in as the full time WR3 for the time being. That didn’t result in much fantasy production last week, but he should be more of a factor moving forward. If Dorsett misses several weeks Meyers should be a decent add in deep leagues. He gets a decent matchup with the Giants this week who rank 29th in pass defense DVOA. He’s basically a dart throw this week in a game the Pats should run away with.

&nbsp;

**WR Darius Slayton, NYG (Wk. 6: @NE):** Slayton doesn’t have a great matchup this week, but Daniel Jones will have to throw the ball somewhere and Slayton has been the guy he’s had the best connection with among the available options. He’s topped 11 PPR points in two of his last 3 games and costs just $100 more than the minimum on DraftKings. He has nice upside for a bottom of the barrel DFS tournament play, even in this brutal matchup.

&nbsp;

**TE Noah Fant, DEN (Wk. 6: vs. Ten.):** Fant saw his lowest target total of the season last Sunday and was outscored by teammate Jeff Heuerman, but he remained right around the same snap share that he’s been playing (66%). The Broncos got an early lead and leaned on the run game against the Chargers. This week’s matchup is one to target with tight ends. The Titans have allowed a tight end score in 4 of 5 games this year and allowed a 9-130 line to Austin Hooper in the other game. Fant is a solid TD dart throw this week.

&nbsp;

**TE Josh Oliver, JAX (Wk. 6: vs. NO):** I mention Oliver this week because the Jaguars’ starting tight end James O’Shaughnessy suffered a season-ending ACL tear this week. I wouldn’t be racing to the waiver wire to pick him up in any redraft formats, but he may be worth a flier in deep dynasty leagues, especially TE premium formats. Oliver was the team’s primary pass catcher as a senior at San Jose State last year, hauling in more than 21% of the team’s catches, and more than 22.5% of their receiving yards. Geoff Swaim and Seth DeValve are both likely ahead of Oliver on the depth chart, but Jacksonville has utilized 3 tight ends this season, and Oliver may be the best receiver of the healthy trio. DeValve had played at least 22% of the offensive snaps each of the past 3 weeks as the team’s TE3. DeValve hasn’t seen a single target this year, and Swaim has turned 15 targets into 12 catches for just 60 yards. Monitor how much Oliver is used this week. If he has an obvious passing game role, he should become a guy worth adding in redraft formats.

&nbsp;

That’s all I’ve got for this week. Hopefully it helps you with your toughest decisions involving rookies this week. Keep a close eye on the injury report this week. There are a ton of injuries that could have an impact on these outlooks – Marquise Brown, Sammy Watkins, Tyreek Hill, Saquon Barkley, Christian Kirk, Phillip Dorsett, etc. Make sure you know what injuries may affect your lineup and have a backup plan ready for Sunday. As always: Good luck, trust your gut, and have fun. It’s just a game.

Is it time to sell high on amari cooper?,"Here is my thinking-

1. He has multiple injuries
2. Cowboys generally get worse as weather gets colder 
3. Dallas refuses to commit to him long-term so far and may want to see if their younger wrs can play

In general I guess it’s hard for me to see him keeping this up all year. Would you try to sell high right now on cooper? Who would you target?

Misleading Position vs. Defense Rankings - Minshew Week 6,"As many likely already know, the standard Position vs. Rankings can be misleading.

I was going with the Mustache this week and he's playing the NO Saints. According to Yahoo and our QB scoring system, the Saints are 2nd worst against a QB. I didn't understand how they were considered so poor against QB's, so I looked into it. It's all rushing TD's and one terrible week against Russell.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tun0tu8kdsr31.png

The NO vs. QB's is inflated due to rushing TD's and an incredible game by Russell. I believe Minshew to be a quality QB, but this week I'm much less confident and thinking I'll go with Jimmy G.

Also, I'm working on automating a ton of stats using VBA and Excel ( \[you can see what I have right here\]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0QsofGZBASmdQL52JKgVF05lRk1CP07\_56\_gYaAaHg/edit#gid=2105506129](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0QsofGZBASmdQL52JKgVF05lRk1CP07_56_gYaAaHg/edit#gid=2105506129) ), but looking for recommendations on simplifying/visualizing the information into something more digestible. I want to weight the data and visualize using a chart, but also have the more raw information accessible to explain/understand the analysis/outcome. In the link above you can see that a lot of green in the row equals a good match-up for that team. And FYI, opp information matches to the teams opponent for this week.  Team X vs. Y, shows Y's opponent stats.

So use Vegas, Team RZ Opportunities, Opp RZ Opportunities, RZ TD's/G, Opp RZ TD's/G, RZ Rushing, RZ Passing, Team Stats, etc. And add more individual stats to the spreadsheet analysis (WR1 vs def, WR2 vs. def, SlotWR vs. Def, etc.)

This derailed, any help/suggestions are much appreciated.

TLDR: Minshew isn't as safe of a play as presented on your Fantasy Apps.

Josh Gordon is Who you Should Have Thought He Was,"Much has been made of Gordon’s disappointing beginning to the season. He’s had a couple of duds and a couple of good games through a mediocre start to his season. However, you should have seen one of these duds coming against a Buffalo defense that gave the entire Pats passing offense trouble – to the tune of keeping Brady under a completion percentage of 50% for 150 yards and an interception. The other was the only game AB played with the Pats, against a historically bad team. 


**What should you have expected from Gordon?** 

I figured a look at last year should be the frame of our expectations. I threw out three of his twelve games - one of which came with the Browns, and two of which were well below what looks to be his usual snap share of just over 80%. On a snap share of 82.44% and a target share of 18.56%, Gordon averaged 4 receptions on 6.9 targets for 70.89 yards and 0.22 TDs a game. That’s per game averages of 10.42 0.5ppr ppg. Over the course of 2018, that ranks him at WR32 for ppg in 0.5ppr, just above Mike Williams.  


**How does this compare to his four (excluding MIA) games this year?**

For starters, I threw out that Miami game – it was the only game AB played, and against the awful phins. On a snap share of 83.25% and a target share of 16.04%, Gordon has averaged 4.25 receptions on 7.5 targets per game for and average of 65.25 yards and 0.25 TDs/game. That’s 10.18 0.5ppr ppg. On the year, that average would rank him just above Christian Kirk at the #45 WR in hppr ppg. Honestly, this seems to jive pretty closely to his year last year.  


**Anything else to consider?**

Gordon’s got five red zone targets this year, compared to his seven throughout the nine games he played the majority of offensive snaps all of last year – that implies he’s being targeted in the redzone at double his pace last year. He’s tied among WRs for shares in the redzone with Edelman, and is ceding a lot of redzone work to the Patriots back-field, along with the rest of the receiving corps. 

His target share of 16.04% (excepting the MIA game) this year is down from his 18.56% from last year, and his true catch rate (adjusts for catch-able balls), per player profiler, is down from last year (75.9% vs 73.1%) – but given the number of games we’re talking about here, I’d say these differences are damn near a wash, with a little more concern about the drop in target share, but not much.  

Excluding the MIA game, Gordon’s got 303 air yards, a damn near dead-heat with Edelman (at 306), and good for ~25% of the Pats’ total and he’s second on the team in targets at 30 (vs Edelman’s 37). 


**So, what’s his outlook?**

It seems like things are standing Pat from last year, when you consider his averages are pulled down by his Buffalo game – one of his toughest match-ups of the year. There’s also encouraging possible uplift to his outlook via increased redzone targets. Gordon looks like he’s one of the top receiving options on a good offense with a HoF QB that may or may not have its ceiling limited because of favorable game scripts that lead to them drawing out possessions and clock time. His usage through his last 13ish Pats games indicates that he’s a WR3ish play, with upside to break a 15-20 point game here and there.    

Another possible indicator for upside is the fact that Gordon got absolutely fed in game 3 against the Jets when Edelman went out of the game early with his chest injury. With Burkhead and Dorsett looking to be out this game, it will be interesting to see how this affects both Gordon’s target share and his redzone usage – as well as what he does with the opportunity in a good match-up. If he gets added work here, it could be a good sign for targeting potential high-upside games down the stretch.  


**TL/DR**: 

Gordon seems to be a possible flex-play, based on match-up, and a decent bye week fill-in, with the potential for a greater work-load/floor if the Patriots are missing players due to injury. But I would hold off expecting Gordon to achieve much more than WR3 status before the end of the year. He’s bench depth with the potential for upside, but probably not a fantasy asset you need to keep a tight hold on. I’d imagine there are people out there who are still willing to chase his upside as a trade throw-in, which is probably the best place to squeeze some value right now if you don’t foresee starting him anytime soon.",121,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg502l/josh_gordon_is_who_you_should_have_thought_he_was/,6226.333643285433,r/fantasyfootball

**How You Can Help Contribute To This Post:**

I've noticed that in this post (and across most posts in /r/fantasyfootball) most of the comments ask for starting advice for your roster and there are already dedicated Index articles to answer those questions. Instead focus on picking up/dropping players, ROS performance, fliers, matchup rankings, trends, etc. those will help out everyone instead of just your team. Also, the mods have locked this post before when the comments fill up with things that should go into the INDEX posts.

If you see any discrepancies between this post and the source articles please comment or upvote comments to get them to the top. I'll add updates to the title post to fix any errors or add updates.

Patriots' Defense is overrated as Fuck,"People keep talking like they're a great defense.  Are they good?  Sure.  But, most people would be good against HORRIBLE offenses.  Who have they played this year?

Pittsburgh, with a Ben Roethlisberger who looked like shit, and couldn't throw.

Miami(enough said).

Jets(enough said).

Bills(their one standout performance, but that said... it's Josh Allen, and it's the Bills).

Washington redskins(enough said).


4/5 performances were against horrible teams, with horrible offenses.  I think some people are failing to realize... while the patriots have been very successful on D, and will probably do good ROS... they aren't some amazing defense.  It largely has to do with the fact they have one of the easiest schedules in NFL history this year.

When they play an actual offense, that's not historically bad... I would expect their cracks to show.

In-Season Adjustment (Week 6 RB),"Welcome back to the Week 6 edition of In-Season Adjustment. 

**What this is**: an attempt to predict the rest-of-season (ROS) value of players based on how they've performed given their matchups thus far and the difficulty of their remaining schedule (strength of schedule or SOS). I looked at the expected performance a player should have had given the matchups in Week 1-5 and applied that multiplier of over/under performance to the matchups they have in Weeks 6-16. 

This week I’ve added strength of schedule (SOS) for overall ROS, regular season (weeks 6-12), and playoffs (weeks 13-16). I’ve also added the number of top 10 matchups remaining in their schedule overall as well as in the playoffs. 

Some notes of caution: we are still working off a 5 game sample. These are predictions and while I hope that it will be more accurate than that of a fantasy analyst ranking ROS based on gut feel and qualitative factors, huge games can still sway the results. When making trades, get a trade that reflects the current value of the players and you should be golden, assuming you’re getting the better schedules. I find that most people do not look ahead at schedules as much as they should when evaluating a trade, take advantage of that. 

For the RB edition I also added a total TDs scored column. Because TDs have such an outsized outcome on the results (and in real fantasy) I added this so you can be aware of how TD scoring is affecting how certain players are ranked. The best example to illustrate this is Aaron Jones, he has 8 TDs leading to him being ranked #5 ROS. I would expect some regression so would not recommend buying Jones or trust the ROS rank for Jones. 

Let’s review the previous week’s recommendations. 

**Previous Week BUYs**

I said to buy Cook, Bell, and KC RBs. Of these, I missed on KC RBs. What previously looked like a decent ROS schedule has transitioned to a below average schedule. An underperformance against the Colts also led to a substantial decline in rankings. 

I cannot emphasize how much of an opportunity Bell represents with the world’s best schedule, huge usage, a returning Darnold, and only 1 TD to his name (the Jets are bad but more scoring opportunities will come with the better schedule). He had a brutal opening schedule and the owner will not be valuing him highly. After NE in week 7, it’s going to be smooth sailing.

**Previous Week SELLs**

I said to sell Kamara, David Johnson, and Mixon. None of those are misses based on the model this week. Kamara and DJ have horrible, horrible schedules with only one top 10 matchup remaining in their fantasy seasons. This week is Kamara’s last top-tier matchup and DJ’s occurs in Week 7. Get an RB with a safer schedule. 

Mixon’s schedule looks more favorable than last week, leading to a rise in the rankings. Still don’t have confidence in the Bengals O-line but his prospects are improving.

**Previous Week HOLDs**

I said to hold Zeke, Gurley, and Fournette. Of these, Gurley and Fournette are looking like good holds and Zeke is looking like a miss. I should have told you to sell but I was scared of retribution. He underperformed his matchup again. I removed Week 1 from the model where he split with Pollard and it still didn’t help him much. Like Kamara and DJ, he has a brutal ROS schedule that you want no part of. Get Zeke’s name value while you still can.

**BUY**

* Bell, Cook (from previous week)

* Josh Jacobs: Has one of the best schedules remaining, I wouldn’t pull the trigger just yet but he’s intriguing if Oakland continues to be able to run the ball. 

* SF RBs: I haven’t ranked them yet due to small sample size but they have a great regular season schedule and a team committed to running the ball. Monitor them. 

**SELL**

* Kamara, DJ, and Mixon (from previous week)

* Ezekiel Elliot: It pains me to do it but it’s unlikely to get better given the schedule and his performance thus far. He only has 2 top 10 matchups left and the next one happens Week 11 against the Lions. It’s far enough away that you’re probably maximizing trade value by cutting bait now.

**HOLD**

* Gurley and Fournette (from previous week).

Dear r/ffl - I started a service where we will take over abandoned teams for a low fee. Can I get your feedback?,"In our friendly league, it seems that at least one team stops playing by the end of the year, and it sucks for the people who are still trying. Usually the commish (me) ends up taking it over and setting their line-up every week, and then we don't let the abandoned team participate in trades. Its not much fun and its a bunch of work for the commish.

I considered using the FantasyPros autopilot tool this year, but what we really want is someone else to take over the team and play the season out - that way the other teams get to play real games against a real person, and the team can still participate in trades. Problem is, no one seems to want to take over someone else's losing fantasy team halfway through the season. Go figure.

So my friend and I are trying an experiment - we're offering to take over the abandoned teams in anyone's league for the rest of the season for $10. We put together a little website here at [FantasySaver.com](https://fantasysaver.com/?ffl) and would really appreciate your feedback. I'm a bit worried we might get ourselves in over our heads, but let's see what happens!

I would love to know what you think of the idea, the price, and why you would or would not use this. All feedback, positive or negative, is deeply appreciated.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Jonathan Hilliman (59%, 10, 2) Elijhaa Penny (33%, 4, 1) Wayne Gallman (6 snaps then INJ)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


NFL primetime matchups have been largely disappointing (outside of SNF and the last two TNF), and this week should be no different. Danny Dimes reverted back to normal dude **Daniel Jones (downgrade)** last week, and will be offered as human sacrifice on national television without his starting running back, backup running back, No. 1 receiver and tight end...going against the league's top rated defensive unit. It’s fully expected to be a bloodbath and the spread reflects that. Almost 60% of Jones’ target distribution is sitting out injured tonight, so rookie **Darius Slayton** and perennial backup **Cody Latimer** will be thrust into featured roles. Slayton is the preferred play as he could break a long one anytime with his blazing 4.39 speed, but both are recommended fades this week against NE’s #1 ranked secondary. **Golden Tate (upgrade PPR)** should see the training wheels taken off after only playing 46 snaps in his debut, and he’s expected to operate primarily out of the slot in the absence of **Sterling Shepard (concussion)**. Tate is a low-upside, volume based WR3 play in the tough matchup. **Rhett Ellison** is assumed to take over for **Evan Engram** tonight, but is no more than a DFS punt play. 


**RB Breakdown**


Undrafted rookie **Jonathan Hilliman** and FB **Elijhaa Penny** are expected to share the backfield tonight in the absence of **Saquon Barkley** and **Wayne Gallman**. Owners desperate for a running back could consider Hilliman due to his involvement in the passing game in what should be a very negative game-script for NY. However, doing so is an extremely desperate play that isn’t recommended. If anything, Hilliman should be stashed for next week’s game against the Cardinals, as he would become an RB2/3 if Barkley and Gallman sit again. Penny is not a recommended option in any format. 


#**Patriots**


**Opp (NYG) Pass DVOA:** #29


**Opp (NYG) Run DVOA:** #12


**Injuries to Watch DEF (NYG):** LB Lorenzo Carter (Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (NE):** WR Phillip Dorsett (Out), RB Rex Burkhead (Q, not expected to play), WR Julian Edleman (Q, expected to play), WR Josh Gordon (Q, expected to play)


**Key WR/CB matchups:** Josh Gordon vs. Janoris Jenkins (Rotoworld)


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Julian Edelman (21%), James White (20%), Josh Gordon (18%), Phillip Dorsett (15%), Rex Burkhead (12%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Sony Michel (48%, 19, 3) James White (39%, 12, 9) Brandon Bolden (13%, 6, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Patriots assault on lesser teams should continue tonight against the hapless Giants. **Tom Brady** should have plenty of chances to make up for his disappointing performance last week against one of the league's worst pass defenses - consider him a top-5 QB this week. **Julian Edelman (upgrade PPR)** continues to receive the questionable tag, but has played through his chest injury the last few weeks so he should be all systems go tonight. Consider him a WR2 with WR1 upside. **Josh Gordon** is also questionable but expected to play, and it appears that he’ll draw Janoris Jenkins in coverage. It’s not an imposing matchup, Jenkins has been destroyed by the likes of Amari Cooper, Mike Evans and John Brown this year (Rotoworld). Additionally, in the absence of **Phillip Dorsett** ‘Flash’ should assume more volume - he’s an upside WR2 play. Rookie **Jakobi Meyers** will fill in for Dorsett, but isn't an option outside of being a long shot DFS tournament play. The Patriots decided not to activate tight end **Benjamin Watson** this week after he served his four game suspension, so they will move forward with **Matt LaCosse** and **Ryan Izzo** for the time being. Neither are fantasy options. 


**RB Breakdown**


In a dream matchup last week against the Redskins, **Sony Michel** finally produced for fantasy owners, but his day was not as big as many hoped for. He’ll get another chance tonight against a porous Giants defense. He’s a back-end RB2, but could have a monster day if the Patriots run up the score, giving him plenty of goal line touches. Michel is tied for the league lead with 13 rushing attempts within the opponents 10 yard line (https://fantasyfootballers.org/rushing-red-zone-stats/), positive touchdown regression is coming. Additionally, his involvement in the passing game was a welcome surprise last week, and if it continues it would be a huge boon for his floor. **James White** should again assume most of the passing game work, but could be game-scripted out similar to last week. Consider him a solid RB2 in the expected blowout. **Rex Burkhead** is questionable but not expected to play tonight.

I looked at the expected performance a player should have had given the matchups in Week 1-5 and applied that multiplier of over/under performance to the matchups they have in Weeks 6-16. 

This week I’ve added strength of schedule (SOS) for overall ROS, regular season (weeks 6-12), and playoffs (weeks 13-16). I’ve also added the number of top 10 matchups remaining in their schedule overall as well as in the playoffs.

When making trades, get a trade that reflects the current value of the players and you should be golden, assuming you’re getting the better schedules. I find that most people do not look ahead at schedules as much as they should when evaluating a trade, take advantage of that. 

Let’s review the previous week’s recommendations. 

**Previous Week BUYs**

I said to buy Winston, Ryan, Murray, and Brissett. Of these, all have held up as buys with the exception of Brissett who moved down from rank #6 to #13 due to an underperformance at KC. Going forward, I still recommend Ryan as a strong buy and Winston and Murray as buys (but with lower conviction than Ryan). 

**Previous Week SELLs**

I said to sell Dak, Mayfield, Rodgers, and Watson. Watson is the only miss here as he has moved up to QB #5 ROS from his previous position of #12 with his huge game. I would still recommend caution with Watson as he has a below average schedule but it is actually decent for the regular season and only becomes truly bad in weeks 13-16. 

Dak may have put up decent points but his point total was in line with expected performance and he has an absolutely brutal schedule remaining (including in the playoffs). Rodgers moved up slightly but he continues to have a tough schedule remaining in the regular season, only improving for the playoffs. 

**Previous Week HOLDs**

I said to hold Mahomes and Wilson. Wilson turned in a monster performance and should be a buy if you can get him. He has one of the better schedules remaining. Mahomes is still a hold for this week but barring an absolutely massive performance, I’ll be advising you to sell next week. This week is his last top-10 matchup until Week 13, he has the worst ROS schedule and the worst playoff schedule. He’s still a great QB but you should be able to get similar performance from someone much cheaper and upgrade your team substantially at another position. 

##This Week

**BUY**

* Ryan, Winston, Murray (from previous week)

* Gardner Minshew: The model actually had him ranked as the #8 QB ROS last week and he’s only improved on that. Like most people, I didn’t rank him as a buy because I wanted to see more. He has a top tier schedule left and one of the top playoff schedules. My main concern would be whether Foles has truly lost his job (he will if Minshew’s stellar play continues). 

* Russell Wilson: A good enough schedule to be assured of consistent performance, he’s going to be great rest of season. However, you’ll have to pay full value and this analysis is more about finding unexpected value and predicting which studs are sellable due to ROS schedule. 

* Sam Darnold: Keep an eye on this situation just for the schedule. I haven’t ranked due to lack of sample size but he has one of the easiest schedules across the board.

**SELL**

* Dak, Mayfield, Rodgers (from previous week)

* Carson Wentz: He was ranked #9 but with Philly running over the Jets he turned in a disappointing fantasy day. He has the worst regular season schedule remaining, sell him now and re-buy for the playoffs. He has 3 top-10 matchups left in the schedule and they all fall in weeks 13-16. 

**HOLD**

* Patrick Mahomes: Still hold for this week but he’ll be a sell next week. Get Mahomes value while you can. He has a top 10 matchup this week against Houston but it’s tough sledding from there and an abysmal playoff schedule. Grab one of the buys and upgrade your lineup substantially elsewhere with the value you get from selling.

* Lamar Jackson: Hold for this week’s matchup. After that, sell prior to the bye or hold on and sell before the playoffs after week 11 against Houston. He gets SF, BUF, NYJ, CLE in the playoffs. None of those are top tier matchups and playing SF/BUF in your opening rounds is a recipe for disaster.

Panthers Offense Snap Counts,"So I write the snap count articles over at [FantasyAlarm.com](https://FantasyAlarm.com) and I just wanted to share this with this sub because I found it kind of interesting.  I did some write ups on the [Patriots backfield](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/d8rwii/oc_patriots_backfield_clarification/) and [Broncos backfield](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dcb16q/oc_broncos_backfield_clarification/) over the last couple weeks because they jumped out to me as well - this has caught my eye in previous weeks but just wanted to wait until the sample size was bigger.

As you know, some teams use a ton of different players and packages while others use a more concentrated group.  For instance, when healthy, the Rams use 11 personnel (3 WR, 1 RB, 1 TE) almost 90% of the time and it's almost always Cooks, Woods, and Kupp in the game for WR though they move around RBs and TEs and sometimes use Josh Reynolds.  Some teams like the Ravens use so many guys that a lot of weeks no position player plays more than 65-70% of the snaps.  For instance week 2 Marquise Brown (64.9%) and Nick Boyle (61%) were the only offensive players besides the QB and O-line to play more than 60% of the snaps.  For fantasy, you really would prefer to have both A. the snaps consolidated and B. the targets consolidated so it's easier to predict who will be out there and who will get the ball.  Makes our job much easier.

Which brings me to the Panthers this year.  In recent years, I have not seen a team use such a consolidated group of offensive players.  They are playing like it's the early 2000s where you just have your starters and they just play every play.  And it's getting more consolidated each week.

In week 4, the QB, lineman, and McCaffrey played every snap and Olsen played all but 1.  Of the starting 11, the guy who played the least was Jarius Wright and he played 70.1%.  This week DJ Moore joined them at 96.8% and Jarius Wright played 77.8%.  To put that in perspective, the starter who played the \*least\* snaps of their starting 11 this week would have had the 3rd highest snap share logged by any position player on the Ravens \*all season\*.  Only Willie Snead and Hollywood Brown played a higher snap share in week 4 alone than the Panthers 11th player.  There were 63 snaps in the Panthers game last week and the next closest guys after the top 11 were Bonnafon (who played 11 snaps because McCaffrey got a little banged up, usually he plays 0) and Ian Thomas at TE who played 11 snaps as well which is about a 17% snap share.  The only team that has come close to this at all was actually the Cowboys this week where most of their starting position players player 70-80% of the snaps and Blake Jarwin played 31% but the Panthers are doing in consistently every single week.  The Cowboys were all logging numbers in the 80% range? Week 2 the Panthers had 75 offensive snaps and CMC played 75, Samuel played 73, and Moore played 71.  Each of CMC, Moore, Samuel, and Olsen have logged at least one snap share of 97% and some of them have logged multiple.  Same 11 guys, all game, week in and week out.  Ron Rivera has his guys LOCKED in.

&#x200B;

There's no real point beyond the notion that, unlike some other teams, you don't need to guess who is going to get the snaps for the Panthers each week, even at the back end of the lineup.  It's McCaffrey, Olsen, Moore, Samuel, and Wright and that's it.  If the offense was a little better, this would be amazing for fantasy but, as of now, you obviously start McCaffrey and then you can start DJ Moore and Greg Olsen where you need them and Samuel in a pinch.  If Cam comes back healthy and is slinging it to Moore like he was (24 targets over the first two weeks) he could end up being a huge asset down the stretch.",7,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dg18p3/panthers_offense_snap_counts/,6486.066977783044,r/fantasyfootball

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team’s matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you’re in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‘Em game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn’t give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

"Official: [Simple Questions and League Issues] - Thu Afternoon, 10/10/2019","**DO NOT post Who Do I Start, Add Drop, or Trade questions in this thread; find the appropriate thread within the [INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day).**

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Is there a *free resource for estimated points ROS to help compare trade values between players?,"I've seen estimated points for the season, but those were from just before week 1.  Now that we're a 5 weeks in, those values aren't necessarily a good estimate anymore.  For example, [https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections](https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections) shows AB getting 240 this year....

The perfect stats would show me the estimate points from now until week 16, full PPR.  I'd take raw stats (yds/TDs) too, and I'll score them myself.  Or even a site that shows the current estimated 2019 season total, and I'll subtract the past 5 weeks from that.  
For example: Kelce (#1) vs Kittle (#2).  That was a -20pt difference ROS if you look at 2018 stats.  Is that about the same projection for this year?

"What's the ""right way"" to run a keeper league?","This is the first year that our league decided on keepers for 2020. We are a 10 team auction league, currently running on ESPN. We decided that we can select 2 keepers this year, but we dropped the ball in terms of the finer points, which is what I am trying to sort out now.... (better late than never)??

So just looking for a little advice...

As we are an auction league, does it make sense for us to have that player cost us the same as it did this year? Would you recommend adding a nominal amount to the player's price the following year? So if CMC cost you $65 this year, does he cost you $70 if you want to keep him this year?

Is there a maximum number of years you should be permitted to keep a player?

Can you keep players that you have picked up off waivers or obtained through a trade? If so, how are those players valued?

Let's Talk About What Happens When Nick Foles Returns and What That Means for Minshew.,"The Jaguars have expressed expectations that Nick Foles will return this season. At best he can return from IR week 11.

While week 11 is a long way off, I think it certainly warrants discussion. Jacksonville clearly has a diamond in the rough with Minshew, if they end up getting a franchise QB in the sixth round then they've clearly struck gold. However, they just paid their FA QB 22 million per year with the promise that he *finally* gets to be the #1 guy on his team. Do you play the hot hand and keep going with Minshew, or give the ball back to your more experienced Super Bowl MVP?

Minshew is currently QB11 and his value is going to skyrocket with the Jags soft schedule weeks 6-9 (NO, @CIN, NYJ, HOU). The Jags then have a week 10 bye and then Foles may very well be back week 11 (@IND).

 This could potentially make Minshew a strong stash-and-flip as he is currently owned in only 54% of Yahoo leagues. QB has been a tough position this season with injuries as well as highly-touted prospects falling very short of expectations. Holding Minshew or using him to cover a bye and then flipping him to a QB needy team might be a smart move considering his schedule and uncertain future. 


So essentially the two questions are:

-Is there a real chance that the Jaguars start Nick Foles when he returns from injury? 

-Based on the answer to the above, is Gardner Minshew II a potential sell-high candidate?",130,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfxycs/lets_talk_about_what_happens_when_nick_foles/,6721.583645403385,r/fantasyfootball

But, in the 1 game that Crowder played with Darnold this year, he had an otherworldly 14 catches on 17 targets. This is the stuff that PPR dreams are made of.

Are you guys rolling him right into your FLEX spot this week, or waiting to see how things shake out?",38,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfwpaf/to_owners_rostering_jamison_crowder_what_are_you/,6829.183645633856,r/fantasyfootball
Mike Evans vs Panthers (James Bradberry),"So the last days I often heard, that Evans historically has bad games against the Panthers, especially against James Bradberry. Because of that I just wanted to see, if I could back that up with stats. This is the collected data of the last 3 years. (Bradberry joined the league in 2016)

https://i.imgur.com/jH1vhO0.png

I hoped for some more clear conclusions, but it is what it is. I at least wanted to share it with you. If it helps someone to decide to start him or not it was already worth it ;)

So you can see last year his results against the Panthers were much much worse compared to his stats against all other opponents. In 2016 and 2017 though that was not the case. He even performed better compared to his overall stats. This year his game against the Panthers was a bit worse compared to the other 4 games, but not much. In addition you have to have in mind he was not 100% in week 2 after his illness and only a short week to recover. Personally I am starting him this week, in fact with a least some confidence ;)",171,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfwl7k/mike_evans_vs_panthers_james_bradberry/,6840.416978983084,r/fantasyfootball

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team’s matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you’re in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‘Em game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn’t give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Discussion: A Tale of Two Quarterbacks,"It was the crab-leggiest of times, it was the moustachiest of times. 

Jameis and Gardner are options for the QB desperate with a lotta potential.  They have a bit more pizazz than a Flacco or Garoppolo, but let's not get crazy here.  They are both on the upswing with increasing ownership.. could be good days ahead says the crowd.

Jameis did well enough against the Saints.  Minshew did great against the Panthers.  Now in week 6, they will switch opponents.. leaving one to wonder about who will have more fun this weekend.

- Is the Panthers D (Bradberry etc) that great?  Minshew and Chark devoured them.  

- Is the Saints D as bad as their stats (opposing QB fantasy production) suggest?  After Jameis put on a show vs. the Rams (respectable defense), the Saints looked pretty darn good against him for most of the game.  I think Jameis completed one of his first 5-6 passes.  

- Based on the above, do you expect Minshew to struggle as Jameis did against the Saints?

- The inverse -- is Jameis going to bodyslam the Panthers D for 5 air TDs, a rushing TD and a field goal?

QB Pass Attempts,"With week 5 in the books, the sample size is decent enough. With that in mind, here are the top 10 fantasy pass attempt leaders as you look for trades with the 0-2 win teams. Last year, having Mahomes would net you around 90 points more than the average in a 12 man league. Matt Ryan and Ben Roe would get you around 20. That’s across the season. You’re looking for TD upside and a reliable 200 yards a game. If you have Mahomes, you get both of these. 

So Mahomes threw for:

383/580 5097y 50TD:12INT.

He scored 4 more points per game than Matt Ryan, the runner up. 

Through 5 weeks, Mahomes had (passing only):

112/176 1513y 14:0

Through 5 weeks 2019: 

**Jared Goff:**

140/222 1649 7:7

**Matt Ryan:**

156/222 1655 11:7

**Andy Dalton:**

129/204 1412 7:4

**Kyler Murray:**

126/201 1324 4:4 (2 rush...ok sorry)

**Patrick Mahomes:**

128/195 1831 11:0

**Philip Rivers:**

133/194 1465 7:4

**Deshaun Watson:**

110/159 1364 11:1

**Rayne Prescott:**

119/171 1606 11:6

**Lamar Jackson:**

106/162 1271 11:5 (only 1 rush, I know you’re thinking it)

Hope it helps. As you can see, some dudes are on pace to throw A LOT. There’s a decent chance we get several QBs in striking distance of Mahomes’ 2018 total on account of way more pass attempts.",20,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfs7nt/qb_pass_attempts/,7315.4669793168705,r/fantasyfootball
Week 6 #FF Streamers,"Raise your hand if you were blown out last week! Sheesh, that's a lot of hands. If you raised your hand, don't worry! A loss is a loss no matter how you slice it, but it's a new week. It's time to redeem yourself and get back on track!

In this article, I'm going to highlight 2 top streamers per position in deep and shallow leagues along with BONUS streamers to consider if the highlighted players are already taken in your league. (Per Yahoo)

QB

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Jimmy Garoppolo (59% owned) at Chiefs

It doesn't get any safer than Jimmy G. He barely qualifies for this post since his ownership is hovering around 60% (and is sure to go up), but he needs to be mentioned as a potential streamer. This week he goes on the road to face the LA Rams, who have been giving up a ton of points lately. I expect this to be a high-scoring game, where both teams are going to have to THROW to keep up with each other. I expect Garoppolo to crack AT LEAST the Top-15 this week. 
Other QBs to consider streaming: Gardiner Minshew II (25% owned) vs Saints, Kirk Cousins (41% owned) vs Eagles


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Sam Darnold (13% owned) vs Cowboys

Making his long-awaited return from mono, Darnold is back and fully healthy. He's coming back to an offense that boasts a lot of skilled position players in Le'Veon Bell, Robby Anderson, Jamison Crowder, and Chris Herndon. There might be some rust to shake off coming back from the illness, but I expect the talent around him to help him overcome the rust. Start him in a DEEP league with confidence. 
Other QBs to consider streaming: Marcus Mariota (14%) at Oak, Teddy Bridgewater (9%) at Jax

RB

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Kenyan Drake (56% owned) vs Redskins

Let me preface this by saying, the running back pool below 60% ownership is BRUTAL. The show must go on, though! I expect Drake to deliver serviceable FLEX numbers in a competitive game between two tanking teams. He has clearly earned the trust in this offense over Ballage, and he will be relied upon to move the ball down the field.
Other RBs to consider streaming: Adrian Peterson (47%) at MIA, Rex Burkhead (27%) vs NYG


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Chase Edmonds (5% owned) vs Falcons

If I thought RBs under 60% ownership was brutal, I spoke TOO soon. If David Johnson misses this week, he becomes a legitimate RB2. If Johnson plays then Edmonds is a complete dart throw. He should be used as a second or third flex in a DEEP league just in case he gets extra work with Johnson clearly ailing. 
Other RBs to consider streaming: Ito Smith (15%) at Ari, Giovani Bernard (11%) at Bal

WR

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

DK Metcalf (57% owned) at Browns

When you combine a 6'3 230lb. physical specimen who runs a 4.33 40 yard dash with the efficiency of Russell Wilson, that person becomes a weekly streamer. Despite the tough matchup, I expect Metcalf to be the recipient of a few deep passes, and if he hits on one of them, you have yourself an automatic low-end WR2/high-endWR3.
Other WRs to consider streaming: Mohamed Sanu (42%) at Ari, Jamison Crowder (43%) vs Dal


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

DeVante Parker (9% owned) vs Redskins

Parker is walking into a juicy matchup this week against the Redskins. On the season, he is averaging 6 targets a game. Competitive games are tough to come by for the Dolphins these days, but when a favorable matchup comes around, you need to pounce. Parker could be a sneaky DEEP league flex play. 
Other WRs to consider streaming: Marquise Goodwin (19%) at LAR, Preston Williams (8%) vs WSH

TE

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Gerald Everett (12% owned) vs 49ers

Despite being owned in only 12% of Yahoo leagues, Everett needs to be picked up everywhere and streamed this week in a plus matchup vs the 49ers. He has been coming on strong lately being targeted 20 times over the past two games. He is becoming a key part of this high-octane offense, and I'm picking him up and starting him this week. I'm expecting Top-12 numbers from Everett this week. 
Other TEs to consider streaming: Chris Herndon (30%) vs SF, Jason Witten (54%) at NYJ


Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Noah Fant (13% owned) vs Titans

The Tight End pool becomes extremely thin below 20% ownership, but Fant is a player I'm taking a shot on this week if I'm desperate in a DEEP format. He has all the tools of being a stud fantasy TE for years to come, and the Broncos have been willing to look his way this year to the tune of 3-4 targets per game. I'm expecting the same amount of targets this week and expecting low-end TE2 production. 
Other TEs to consider streaming: Vernon Davis (14%) at Mia, Jordan Akins (7%) at KC

DEF

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Carolina (41% owned) at Buccaneers 

The Panthers have been a Top-5 defense on the year, and they get to face Jameis Winston and the Buccaneers. Expect a few turnovers with a medium amount of points. 
Other DEFs to consider streaming: Denver (29%) vs Ten, Seattle (49%) at Cle

Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Washington (4% owned) at Dolphins

The theme of the year is to stream any defense going up against the Dolphins, right? Might as well keep that train moving here this week, if you're desperate. 
Other DEFs to consider streaming:  Miami (0%) vs Was, Atlanta (3%) at Ari

K

Shallow League Streamer (Owned in less than 60% of Yahoo Leagues)

Jake Elliot (54% owned) at Min

The Eagles high-flying offense visits the Vikings this week, and I expect Carson Wentz to move the ball well but struggle to capatilize in the red zone from time-to-time.
Other Ks to consider streaming: Josh Lambo (39%) vs NO, Mike Nugent (26%) vs NYG

Deep League Streamer (Owned in less than 20% of Yahoo Leagues)

Zane Gonzalez (17% owned) vs ATL

Zane Gonzalez is criminally under-owned. He plays for a fast pace, high-flying offense that finds themselves in the red zone consistently and failing to cash in on touchdowns. I expect Zane to see a few FGs in this game, giving him a solid floor. 
Other Ks to consider streaming: Dan Bailey (10% owned) vs Phi, Brandon McManus (5%) vs Ten

The Community is low on Kirk Cousins this week. I'm starting him and I feel fine.,"Cousins has been a disappointment this year, not just for people that thought he would be a startable top 12ish QB, but for those that spent early picks on Diggs and Thielen thinking they were getting a top 12 WR.

I know Zimmer wants to run run and run some more but I think week 4 was a breaking point for this offense. Diggs wanting out, Thielen telling the media they need to throw more. Cousins went out and did what was expected against the Giants and finally had a good fantasy day. I get it, the Giants D stinks. So now coming off of what could possibly be a turning point for this offense, against another defense that has struggled to slow anyone down we are staying away from Cousins?

I know the Eagles defense just shut down the Juggernaut Jets with future HOF'er Nick Faulk (Folk? who cares) so their numbers against opposing QB's are going to look a little beefy after week 5. I'm not getting fooled by this. This is the same defense that let Case Keenum throw for 380 and 3 TD's in week 1. Additionally Cousins has 8 career games against the Eagles and is averaging 302 yards and 2.25 TD's a game.

I'm not saying he's a top 5 option but I think the community is dismissing him in favor of guys like Kyle Allen and Baker Mayfield. All I'm saying is if you were savvy enough to stream him last week and Minshew or Stafford aren't on the waiver wire, don't panic. Just bust open some grape soda, throw on some Creed and let it ride for one more week. It's all good man.",66,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfrg7q/the_community_is_low_on_kirk_cousins_this_week_im/,7384.383646015326,r/fantasyfootball

Below is a link of the logo's to the league if you want to check them out.  All I ask is that I have full creativity as exact requests will be tough.  Give me your team name and I'll take it from there.  If you have something you're dying for let me know and if I have extra time or it's not intense I'll give it a go.  These will not be 100% original all the time but they will be unique!

&#x200B;

Edit:

I will be making these in order that the request came in. If your logo request is racist, dumb, makes no sense, requires a lot of custom work or is very similar to another users than it will be skipped.

If you want to use a logo created but with your team name reply to the imgur post for that logo with your team name and I’ll make it.

These are going to take a while but I’ll do my best to get them done.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

Please stop PMing me.  I will purposefully not make your logo.  Post in here, wait in line, pray.

Please search for your logo if you have a popular team name, i.e. Baby Chark",1122,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfqs1y/need_a_logo_ill_make_you_one/,7441.783646102746,r/fantasyfootball

How to use Fantasy Points Against D/ST,"Hi everyone, attempting to get a better understanding of how team defenses work  to make a calculated decision on which IDP players could  hit 15+ points any given week instead of blindly picking ""Most Fantasy Points"" . Appreciate any help 

Through 5 weeks, NYJ (23), TEN ( 22), ARI (21), CIN (20), TB and MIA (18) are the teams that have allowed the most sacks to opposing D/ST's. NYJ number is even crazier because they've only played 4 games. 

15.5 of 23 sacks NYJ have allowed came from Defensive Ends, TEN 12 of those 22, but ARI gave up their 13/21 sacks NOT to Defensive Ends but to LB's (only 6 of the sacks ARI has allowed went to DE position).

 Anyways my question is, is there a reason why The Cardinals are getting sacked so much by LB's and the Jets and Titans are being sacked by a majority of DE's in such an inverse amount?Does this have to do with the QB play of Kyler Murray?  Also Which OL position  are at fault (if any) for allowing all those sacks to come from LB or DE? I'm trying to understand the game more and get that this is a question that would annoy some so i apologize for the ""noob"" feel of it.Total Fantasy Points"" always have  Van Der Esch, Martinez, Schobert at the top,  but if I'm understanding the trend correctly when playing the JETS pick DE over LB for a possible sack, FF and maybe if lucky a TD. If anyone could shed some light and explain why this would be I'd greatly appreciate it !

Thank you!",6,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfpvyc/how_to_use_fantasy_points_against_dst/,7513.183646217982,r/fantasyfootball
Kyler Murray - A Sleeper?,"Bear with me here... I'm not sure what his ownership average is in the average sized league, but I got him off the waiver wire last week. Here are some statistics that suggest he has plenty more upside than we've seen:

\- If we take his average rushing yards for the first 5 games of the season we get 659 yards. Only 13 QB's have rushed for over 659 yards in the history of the NFL

\- If we take the average of his most recent 3 games, he's on pace for 1008 yards. The only quarterback to do that in history is none other than Mike Vick. Keep in mind i'm NOT trying to compare him to Vick, nor am I saying that he's going to maintain his rushing pace, but it is a statistic to keep note of.

\- He's 8th overall for fantasy QB's this season as a rookie. This isn't exactly the unique part however - the unique part is that he's only thrown 4 touchdowns thus far. Being able to throw to Kirk and Fitzgerald suggests this number can only increase in the future, strictly based on their pedigree.

\- His only passing TD's were against two respectable defences: Detroit & Carolina.

\- He is only second to Lamar Jackson in rushing yards by QB's. Furthermore, he is ahead of James Connor, Devonta Freeman & Duke Johnson in rushing yards to name a few.

I know this analysis isn't crazy in depth, I just created it to give you an idea of why he's worth rostering in most leagues. Don't take everything I said as you HAVE to get him at all costs, I just figured I'd give him the credit he hasn't quite gotten yet. Good luck this season!",46,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfplh0/kyler_murray_a_sleeper/,7536.91697956721,r/fantasyfootball

Why You Should Buy: Kenny Golladay,"Five weeks into the season, and I think we have some real data - time to start making some sharp trades!

-Deep Diving on one player at a time to help keep comments/questions on topic, I realize this is a lengthy post - I hope you find it useful. 


**Starting point — Magic numbers.**
2018s Top 12 WRs, all but 4 WRs had **150+ Targets AND 100+ Rec.**
(the 4 others all had 130ish targets and 85ish Rec)

Why these matters - I maintain that **9+ targets a game** is the elite (aka WR1) threshold.

—2019 WRs with 9+ targets/game so far:

Cooper Kupp
Michael Thomas
Keenan Allen
Tyler Boyd
Michael Gallup*
Sammy Watkins
Robert Woods
Christian Kirk
Kenny Golladay
Desean Jackson*
Davante Adams
————
(8.8 targets / game)
Julio Jones 
DeAndre Hopkins
Larry Fitzgerald

**The Situation**
First let’s remove *Gallup and DeSean Jackson* - they have missed games which affects their averages. Watkins benefitted from Hill missing 4 weeks (in which Watkins still didn’t produce) 

———
Of the WRs left, Kupp, Thomas, Julio, Hopkins, and Adams are going to be nearly impossible to get from their owners (at least not on the cheap)

**The Candidates:** 
Keenan Allen, Tyler Boyd, Christian Kirk, Kenny Golladay, Robert Woods and Larry Fitzgerald. 

**All of these guys may be good acquisition targets,** and we can discuss them more later, but very quickly why Golladay is the best VALUE imo:

- Keenan Allen still has the name/reputation, making him more expensive. They also got MG3 back which changes things, and lost some O-linemen recently.

- Robert Woods is at best the 3rd option on LAR, and has 0 TDs through 5 games. I don’t think that’s a fluke. 

- Larry Fitzgerald has grey hands, but also has to deal with a rookie QB, rookie coach, weak O-line and is more of a possession receiver. 

- Christian Kirk, see Fitzgerald above - except he’s also not a Hall of Famer yet...

- Tyler Boyd may be the second WR I’d target (can make a separate post for him if people like) - though his QB is the consistently inconsistent Andy Dalton plus a bad O-line as well. While he may be a good buy target, AJ Green MAY return and change things.


**Finding Value**
We always talk about “buy low”. I think Golladay’s stock is depressed — paying “current fair market price” is NOT same as lowballing - I want Him on my team!

—Here is the case for buying Kenny Golladay—

+ Elite size/speed combination with talented hands and body control. 

+ Elite Redzone target - out of all the guys in this post (*including* the “expensive” WR1s) he’s the **ONLY one** averaging 1.0 TDs/game after 4+ games. 

+ Currently averaging ELITE targets (9.0) **BUT only** 4.6 Rec / game (this is due to one game of 2 rec of 8 &lt;- this is where we find value!

+ Undisputed #1 WR on his team

+ Above average, Veteran QB (Stafford had Megatron for years) 

+ Already had his bye week


**Conclusion**
In my experience (especially these days on Apps) Most people don’t sort/look by Avg per week stats. 

This, along with the bye and a down week 3 makes Golladay’s OVERALL scores look pedestrian:

He’s WR20ish in points (depending on format, PPR even lower) which is a *market inefficiency* and a buying opportunity. 

**TLDR**
I would gladly pay a WR20-25 price for a super talented receiver who I think will finish as WR12+. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him inside the Top 10.

Hope this was helpful, at the very least thought provoking! Happy to hear comments.",320,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfp3a7/why_you_should_buy_kenny_golladay/,7577.633646384875,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Evening, 10/09/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you'd like to discuss something outside of this theme, please try checking the [latest Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day) for a thread that might be more suitable for you. If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"Alright, Digg This","So Diggs is making his owners upset, with his low end points and just not showing up. also Kirk Cousins is not helping the owners out at all. BUT, hear me out. There is a good chance that diggs (and likely thielen) break out this week. Minnesota play the eagles this week. This is a great time to start diggs. Philidelphia are great against the run. allowing an average 19.1 points in PPR, on the other hand they allow an average of 45.7 points in PPR to WR.  Also Wentz is a lot better than chase daniels and trubisky. So theres a higher chance Cousins has to sling it.

so this gives our boys diggs and thielen a chance to pop off. Dalvin will still eat im sure, but Diggs and thielen will be the ones to have a great game.

"Does your league reward overall points or just the ""Super Bowl"" winner?","I'm commissioner of two leagues.  The older of the two (going back almost 20 years) has always paid the overall high points winner the larger share of the pot (40% compared to 30% for the Super Bowl).  It's a league of sharps and the stakes are relatively high.  We use real $ for FAAB so if you bid $100 on Galman, you pay $100.   

For the younger of the two leagues which is much lower stakes, I tried to set up a similar pay-out structure and the other owners acted as if I was the craziest thing they'd ever heard of.  This struck me as odd considering total # of points is a much better measure of a team's strength, draft, and roster management whereas the Super Bowl is oftentimes won by an otherwise inferior team.  BTW - not advocating that the Super Bowl winner doesn't get paid - but I think 40%/30% split makes sense.",58,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfn9qh/does_your_league_reward_overall_points_or_just/,7708.550313564142,r/fantasyfootball

Reddit Consensus Positional Rankings [Week 6] (Supplemental Voting Post),"**The original post of this is on Tuesday, but I like to repost it again Wednesday to garner as many eyes on this post meaning more votes for the consensus rankings, making them a more true consensus of what this sub reddit thinks.**

For those that have never seen these posts before, its a pretty simple concept.  
**1.** Each week I'll create a post on Tuesday morning which will link to 4 voting polls, 1 for each of the following positions QB,RB,WR,TE.   
**2.** Each poll will consist of a list of players at that specific position (18-20 for QB & TE polls) and (40-50 for RB & WR polls).  
**3.** The poll will automatically generate a random match-up between 2 of the players from that position, and ask you simply ""Who will perform better in PPR this week?"".  
**4.** All you have to do is choose who you personally think will perform better, ie ""Score More Fantasy Points"".  
**5.** The Polls are never ending and will continue to generate random 1vs1 match-ups until you eventually exit out.   

**To Contribute toward this effort all I ask is that you spend a few minutes to open up each of the following polls and just vote on a handful of generated match-ups, helping create a more true consensus of /r/fantasyfootball**   

[**RB POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/RBrankingsWeek62019 )  

[**WR POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/WRrankingsWeek62019 )  

[**QB POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/QBrankingsWeek62019 )  

[**TE POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/TErankingsWeek62019 ) 

*The idea is to gather as many users from this sub as possible all contributing toward the poll by answering a few ""match-ups"" for each positional poll to gain a consensus rankings that will be posted each Thursday. The ranks allow people that are constantly asking ""start/sit"" questions between two players at the same position to garner the consensus opinion (in ranking form) of the entire sub, vs having maybe 1 to 2 people if that answer their roster decision on the daily index posts. I also will have them compared to the Fantasy Pros Experts' Consensus Ranks when I post the results on Thursdays allowing for the sub to see where we might be high or low in comparison on certain players.*",0,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfmcme/reddit_consensus_positional_rankings_week_6/,7774.433647032579,r/fantasyfootball

terrible pun about mixon,"I wanted to try and write out my thoughts for mixon this week and hopefully start a discussion on the viability of starting him. Let me know if I missed anything or got something wrong, took the stats from ESPN.

**Pros:**

* talent
* baltimore's defense has been vulnerable to RB's, looking at their past schedule:
   * *week 1* @MIA: 0 TD, 12 yds. dolphin bad and the ravens  have destroyed their week 1 opponent the past few years
   * *week 2* vs ARI: 1 TD, 16 yds. worth noting DJ was banged up this game.
   * *week 3* @KC: 1 TD, 124 yds. McCoy + Darrel were solid.
   * *week 4* vs CLE: 4 TD, 192 yds. Chubb is pretty good.
   * *week 5* @PITT: 1 TD, 57 yds. Rudolph almost died (not that their pass attack differed too much after, Hodges might've actually pushed it down the field better). Regardless, 55 + a TD is a respectable day
   * u/issue9mm provided some info about adjustments made by the ravens D after they got Chubbed. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfm7iq/terrible\_pun\_about\_mixon/f346p3v?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfm7iq/terrible_pun_about_mixon/f346p3v?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
* improved YPC the past 3 weeks (>4.0) compared to weeks 1-2 (<2)

**Cons:**

* probability of a negative gamescript considering baltimore's offense
* road game for cincy
* poor RZ rush efficiency = 0/10 (only TD was receiving)

**Additional factor to consider:**

* Potential O-line adjustments: bengals fans would know better than me but I read that they were shifting Price inside and having a competition at LT (Jerry vs Redmond). Unsure of how that exactly will affect Mixon but it can't get much worse right?

&#x200B;

The fact that the ravens have conceded a rushing TD every week besides Miami has me cautiously optimistic about Mixon this week. Obviously this is all dependent on roster construction and league size.

Is Zay Jones worth a pre waivers add?,"With the Zay Jones trade to Oakland news yesterday, seems like really nobody wants to touch the guy unless they have to. Of course, that's mostly because of his inconsistent WR3 production in the past and some bad drops, but if they came out and said he was going to be the WR2 on the team, would you pick him up just to see?

&#x200B;

ZJ obviously came in with high draft stock, and though he never lived up to it yet it seems like the Raiders have high hopes here. Gruden is using the bye to train him, and Mayock, a former draft analyst, actually ranked him as the #4 reciever in the 2017 draft, above JuJu and Kupp. Clearly, that was wrong, but it seems like ZJ is going to have a lot of support coming into the team. 

&#x200B;

Add that to Tyrell Williams dealing with injuries all year, JJ Nelson out last week and not productive on the year, Renfrow not super productive either, it looks like Zay Jones might be walking into a starting job here. You'd also think most teams are focused on stopping Tyrell and Waller, and not giving up big runs to Jacobs.

Chark Bait,"Okay people, week 6 is here and gee willikers is the season flying by.  I want to talk about the man, the myth, the legend who is DJ Chark aka Mr. Sure Hands aka Baby Chark.  After 5 weeks of him blowing up and 5 weeks of most of us benching him, are we starting him this week?

Last week he was shadowed by none other than Bradberry.  This week Chark faces Lattimore who just shut down Evans.  Do you trust him this week? Or is he a 5 week wonder?",82,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dfj7x8/chark_bait/,7995.766981168588,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Afternoon, 10/09/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade

If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.
