Does Russell Wilson have insane pocket awareness?,"Staying in Seattle for a bit, I got the chance to watch some Seahawks games lately. One thing I‚Äôve noticed was Russell Wilson‚Äôs ability to maneuver in the pocket when the opposing offense is trying to get a sack.

There was even a few times in the game against the saints a few weeks ago where a linebacker was trying to tackle Wilson from behind while Wilson was making a pass and he just quickly ducked to avoid the contact and completed the pass to Dissly. He didn‚Äôt even look back to see if there was someone coming from behind. It was literally magic.

"[OC] Total QB damage, the three legged stool, and the new Deshaun Watson","Recently, the Gods of Football Reference blessed us with [advanced offensive](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing_advanced.htm) & [defensive](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/defense_advanced.htm) stats for their player and team pages. This advanced data only starts since last year.

One of the things they've added is quarterback hits (the times a QB hits the ground when there is not a sack). This definition got me thinking about how we think about what I'll call QB damage, or the times a QB gets hit by a defender beyond just getting their jersey pulled a bit. Just using sacks alone gives us really only half the picture as we've seen QBs get [injured from a hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSe-mQWyafQ) despite no sack being recorded.

So I added sacks and hits since 2018 together (updated through week 5) to create what I'll call the Total QB Damage metric.

https://i.imgur.com/MBisvN9.png

As you can see, Deshaun Watson still reigns as the NFL's crash test dummy by about 30 more blows than the next guy. That probably doesn't shock anyone. However Mahomes and Ryan don't seem like two guys who get a lot of talk about how much they get hit, but Mahomes has been hit more than any QB in the past two seasons. We are talking about it now because he's finally gotten hurt, but last year I'm not sure anyone noticed that.

But looking down the list, it immediately got me thinking about what some people call the three legged stool QB.

Football Outsiders [just had a tidbit](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/quick-reads/2019/week-2-quick-reads) about this the other day, trying to quantitatively bucket players into three categories when under pressure:

Bystander - a QB who will wait for coverage to open up instead of throwing it away or throwing into tight coverage, so he probably will be sacked more

Gunslinger - a QB who throws into a tight window thus risking an interception rather than throw it away or wait for a WR to get open, so he will probably be hit more

Game Manager - a QB who will just throw it away under pressure rather than forcing a throw or waiting, so he will probably be sacked/hit the least

QB Styles from 2000-2018 (per FO)

https://i.imgur.com/BQN6ovk.png

Just 2018

https://i.imgur.com/fkp8Xhv.png

Most of these things make sense (Brett Favre in the gunslinger, Deshaun Watson in the bystander, Alex Smith in the game manager).

And when you look at the Total QB Damage list, that matches up a bit. 

Deshaun Watson has been sacked a lot, but is middle of the pack in hits (remember this excludes sacks), like a bystander might be.

Mahomes ranks the highest in hits but amongst the bottom in sacks, like a gunslinger might be.

Joe Flacco and Drew Brees are in the bottom of both, like a game manager might be.

Now going back to Deshaun ""crash test dummy"" Watson, here is Watson‚Äôs average time to throw and rank by year

2019: 2.82 seconds (7th)

2018: 3.01 seconds (4th)

2017: 3.1 seconds (1st)

From 2017 to 2019 Watson has held the ball for about as long as anyone in the league, but here is the thing... [he might be moving](https://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-Deshaun-Watson-sacked-6-times-in-loss-14477541.php) from the bystander category to the gunslinger category (both have their pros and cons and neither is explicitly better than the other).

>""I held the football too long and I fumbled the ball and things like that,"" Watson said. ""The O-line did a hell of a job. That's me. I've got to check the ball down, take what they give us.

That was after the week 4 Panthers loss where he was sacked six times. So in came the Falcons in week 5 and did Watson respond?


2017: 3.1 seconds (1st)

2018: 3.01 seconds (4th)

2019 week 1: 2.73

2019 week 2: 3.01

2019 week 3: 3.02

2019 week 4: 2.91

**2019 week 5: 2.43**

That's the quickest he's gotten rid of the ball in a game in his career (he was regularly posting 3.4+ second hold times at one point including a crazy **3.6 second** average hold time in week 5 of 2017).

In 2017 when Watson got the ball out in under 2.5 seconds, he had a league best 120 passer rating. When Watson took more than 2.5 seconds, it dropped to 91.6.

It remains to be seen obviously if this was a one game blip or Watson is really going to continue to get rid of the ball quicker, but since there is growing consensus that [sacks are](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-z-quarterbacks-in-control-a-pff-data-study-of-who-controls-pressure-rates) mostly [due to](https://theathletic.com/1161053/2019/08/29/russell-wilsons-final-obstacle-and-how-he-seems-to-be-overcoming-it/) the [quarterback](https://www.thebiglead.com/2018/10/19/sacks-are-a-quarterback-stat/), we could see Watson's sack rate plummet, and thus, move down the Total QB Damage list.",21,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dgko2o/oc_total_qb_damage_the_three_legged_stool_and_the/,1519.71455570062,r/nfl

Wagering on any NFL games this weekend? Here are some guaranteed winners:,"(\*\*Don't make bets unless you live somewhere that's it's legal!)

Hi all, I've been handicapping, successfully, for almost 15 years now. While I'm sure nobody will listen to me, nor heed my advice, that's fine. I'm actually just doing this to prove that a skilled handicapper can pick winners 70-75% every year in the NFL. 

&#x200B;

(With at LEAST 16 wagers placed, per year.)

&#x200B;

Week 6: 49'ers vs Rams TOTAL (51) - Under.  (Full unit size bet.)

&#x200B;

No other serious wagers this week. However, for fun, I'm making a 5 team-parley with games that seem favorable, but not approaching certainty. (Note, I only make the wager for 5% of a unit. The catalyst for the wager is entertainment, not a financial incentive.)

&#x200B;

Parlay: Rams/9'ers (Under 51) // Seattle (-1)\* // Cincinnati (+14)\* // Chargers (-3.)\* // Min/Phil Over (44+)

So is this Carr regressing from what I thought was more of a gunslinger role into a more Alex Smith archtype?

Jerry Rice

Does strength of schedule even matter?,"As a result of the most accomplished team in the NFL in the last few decades (arguably ever) currently holding what is projected to be the weakest schedule in the league, there's been a lot of discussion about what that even really _means_ when it comes to how that affects a teams ability to be successful. 

I decided to take a look at the data and see if I could pull anything from it that pointed to what affect, if any, strength of schedule has on a teams ability to get into - and succeed in - the post season. 

I wanted to do at least since realignment, but [the tool I was using for SoS](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/ranking/schedule-strength-by-other?date=2004-01-01) only goes back to 2003 so I'm missing a year. IMO 16 seasons isn't really enough to confirm anything, but if there is a strong correlation between SoS and post season results, we should be able to see _something_ other than totally random results.

I took the SoS for each team as calculated between the final game of week 17 and the first game of the playoffs. A team's record is what gets them the chance to play in the playoffs, and if SoS was a significant factor on deserving teams making the playoffs, we should see teams with the more difficult SoS making the playoffs less often than weak SoS. We might also expect to see that teams with more difficult SoS through the regular season are either losing their first or second post season game having been ""worn out"" by such a long stretch of difficult opponents, or doing exceptionally well by being ""tempered through trial by fire"". You might also expect teams with easy SoS either losing immediately by being ""exposed by an actual competitive team"" or making a long run in the post season due to ""having an easy cakewalk into the postseason"".

It turns out the data doesn't really support any of this. Almost exactly as many teams at the top half of SoS lost their first post-season game as the bottom half. Same as those sitting right in the middle of the pack. 

There were however a few things that seem to stick out. [To see all the data itself, you can look here](https://imgur.com/a/kv0gabi). ( Or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hdOQonil5dwgEm-Y_hFHTcgOmB1bnYmMZfjq7ryuhPA/edit?usp=sharing) if you prefer the full spreadsheet)

Firstly, teams that won 4 games in the postseason (in other words, Wildcards that won the Superbowl) were *all* at the top half of most difficult regular season match-ups. All but one of those six teams were among the top _third_ in difficulty. 

2012 Ravens (4th in SoS) over 49ers

2011 Giants (1st in SoS) over Patriots

2010 Packers (7th in SoS) over Steelers


2007 Giants (8th in SoS) over Patriots

2006 Colts (5th in SoS) over Bears

2005 Steelers (11th in SoS) over Seahawks


Half of all Superbowl winners were ranked in the top third of SoS. Nearly half of all Superbowl losers were the opposite - bottom third in SoS. In addition to suggesting that a stronger schedule means you're more likely to win the Superbowl, this data also suggests having an _average_ SoS could hurt your chances of even appearing in the Superbowl. Among the 32 teams who participated in the last 16 years, only 7 had a SoS between 13th and 24th. 


Below is an example of the data I collected from 2018. You can find [all of 2003-2018 here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qw_Efdz3-XR_669UpMoRTq9lh_y3eROPKSPy9bDI2AA/edit?usp=sharing).

2018| Wins|SoS rank
---|---|----
Colts       	|1 	|31st
Texans      |	0 |	28th
Cowboys     |	1 |	13th
Seahawks  |  	0 	|21st
Chargers    |	1 	|17th
Ravens      |	0 	|7th
Eagles     | 	1 	|11th
Bears       	|0 	|30th

Rams        |	2 	|15th**
Patriots    	|3 	|27th*
Saints      	|1 	|4th


Here's the average SoS ranking for number of playoff wins and Superbowl Winners/Losers:


	Wins|0	|1|	2|	3|	4	|SB Winner|	SB Loser
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
Average	|18.04	|17.62	|15.89	|15.75	|6	|5.4|	18.81

[Bonsignore] Still time for Todd Guley to get right for Sunday‚Äôs game against 49ers but curious how committed Rams would be to run game with no load management in place for Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson.,,6,0.94,https://twitter.com/vinnybonsignore/status/1182441489982316544?s=12,2751.9645582000417,r/nfl
Owning the League: David Tepper,"Tepper‚Äôs background includes a bachelor‚Äôs degree in economics from the University of Pittsburgh and a MBA from Carnegie Mellon University. This being after he graduated from Peabody High School in Pittsburgh‚Äôs East Liberty neighborhood. In 2013 he would donate $67M to Carnegie Mellon and the school would end up naming the Tepper School of Business after him. As of 2018, he is the 188th richest billionaire with a net worth of $11.6B. In 2012, he was the richest hedge fund manager in the U.S, receiving a $2.2B paycheck. In 2018 he was 3rd on Forbes ‚ÄúThe Highest Earning Hedge Fund Managers‚Äù with an annual earning of $1.5B.  

Despite growing into such wealth, Tepper did not start out that way. Tepper was the second of three children to his accountant father and teacher mother. He grew up in a lower-middle class neighborhood in Pittsburgh where he showed a knack for mathematics early on. He was even his sister‚Äôs show and tell project in 2nd grade, showing off his multiplication skills. He even showed early on that he had some good luck, when a fire alarm interrupted a meeting with the school principle regarded the punishment he would get involving a squirt gun fight in school. Although he never earned an A in class, due to being ‚Äúunmotivated‚Äù, he did earn Top Actor for his portrayal of Harry MacAfee in his school‚Äôs rendition of Bye, Bye Birdie. He also enjoyed memorizing basketball and football statistics, I wonder if that would come to be useful later in his life. 

His first two investments were Pennsylvania Engineering Co. and Career Academies, however both companies would end up bankrupt. After his graduation from the University of Pittsburgh, Tepper entered the finance industry as a credit analyst for Equibank. Not happy with this job, he would enroll in Carnegie Mellon University to pursue his his masters. 

After graduating with his MBA in 1982, Tepper accepted a position in the treasury department of Republic Steel in Ohio. He was later recruited to work for Keystone Mutual Funds in 1984, located in Boston. In 1985, Tepper was recruited by Goldman Sachs as a credit analyst in New York City. Within six months, he was promoted to head trader with a speciality in bankruptcies and ‚Äúspecial situations‚Äù. He remained with the company for 8 years and was credited with playing a major role in keeping Goldman Sachs afloat during the 1987 market crash. 

After being passed over for partner twice at Goldman Sachs, Tepper quit in December of 1992 with hopes of launching his own company. After trading away his personal accounts, he had enough money to create Appaloosa Management in 1993. by 2001, he was generating a 61% return, which included historic returns on defaulted bonds, while keeping ‚Äúthe market on edge‚Äù with his investments. He was known for making dicey investments, including investing in MCI, Mirant, Conseco, and Marconi. Later, in a 2010 speech regarding more risky investments, Tepper is quoted as saying ‚ÄúThe point is, markets adapt, people adapt. Don‚Äôt listen to all the crap out there‚Äù.

His risky investments paid off, when his hedge fund made $7B from profits in buying distressed financial stocks that recovered, such as Bank of America. $4B went to his personal wealth, making him the top earning hedge fund manager of 2009. In 2011 he was awarded the Institutional Hedge Fund Firm of the Year. In 2013, Forbes ranked Tepper as the top hedge fund earner of 2012. Making him the 166th wealthiest person in the world.  Tepper would appear in Forbes once again, as one of the top 25 highest earning hedge fund managers in 2013 and 2016. 

On September 25, 2009, Tepper purchased a 5% stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tepper would end up selling his Pittsburgh shares in order to purchase the Carolina Panthers from owner/founder Jerry Richardson. His $2.2B bid was the highest in NFL history and would beat out Ben Navarro, another billionaire businessman. Almost immediately, Tepper announced he has no plans to relocate the Panthers. 

In 2017, it was reported Tepper was worth $11.4B, making him the wealthiest person in New Jersey. 
Tepper is also known for keeping a pair of brass testicles on his desk, which he rubs through out the trading day for good luck. 

Tepper donates $200,000 in gift cards to families in New Jersey following Hurricane Sandy

**Philanthropy**

On March 13, 2003, Tepper announced that he would donate $55M to his alma matter, Carnegie Mellon. This came after a discussing with his previous professor, Kenneth Dunn, who became dean of the schooo. Tepper also suggested that the school be renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business, which happened the following year. 

Continuing his donations to the school in November of 2013, Tepper announced a $67M gift to develop the Tepper Quadrangle on the northern campus of Carnegie Mellon. The quad included a new Tepper School of Business facility, other university wide buildings, and a new welcome center. 

Tepper has also made contributions to the University of Pittsburgh in the form of undergraduate scholarships, donations of several academic centers, and donations for community outreach programs. 

A $1M donation was made to the United Jewish Communities of MetroWest New Jersey toward their Israel Emergency Campaign. 

In March of 2012, Tepper founded a political action group, Better Education For Kids, with his former colleague, Alan Fournier. The goal was to help push for more charter schools and help private schools take over struggling public schools. 

**Pro-Revenge**

* If you recall from earlier in this post, David Tepper was passed over for a promotion. So what does this gentleman do when he acquires his wealth? He pays $43.5 million to purchase that supervisor‚Äôs house, demolished, then rebuilt a home that‚Äôs nearly twice as big

[Week 5 Punt Performance Summary](https://i.redd.it/s2gpxm734sr31.png)

# Good Week for

1. **Matt Wile (ATL, +7 to #6).** Matt‚Äôs back! And, er, Matt‚Äôs gone too. The confounding world of *Players On Atlanta Special Teams Having To Be Called Matt* continues as (Matt) Bosher finally loses the battle with his groin-boink and goes to IR and (Matt) Wile steps in to maintain a Critical Mattness (and hold kicks for \[Matt\] Bryant). [Big Dub](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/f_auto/falcons/ppzj2rfgrmrbc0zzt1qc.jpg) has been a handy      replacement for The Bosh so far and Week 5 was his best yet ‚Äì **5 punts at over 45 Net Average Yards**, including a muffed catch on his final punt of the day which Atlanta turned into a touchdown to make it a one score game      with 11 minutes to play. It‚Äôs not Matt‚Äôs fault that Atlanta managed to ship another three touchdowns in those 11 minutes for a juicy 50-burger in their loss to the Texans. Well not *this* Matt, anyway.
2. **Johnny Hekker (LAR, +6 to #27).** Does scraping his way up to 27th feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù to last season‚Äôs Punt Rank King Johnny Hekker? I sincerely doubt it does, but Week 5 at least started to show what he‚Äôs capable of. Three punts on the day represented a heavy load for Hekk, as Turnover Kings the Rams rank **lowest in Punts Per Drive (0.228)** out of all 32 teams. With his legs no doubt feeling pretty fresh, Hekker went **59, 49 and 45** (from the verrrrry back of his end zone) for a **Net Avg just shy of 50** yards for the week, helping him edge away from the punting foothills. Still a hell of a long way to go to the summit, though. 
3. **Jamie Gillan (CLE, Hold Steady at #8).** DRINK IF THEY SAY SCOTTISH HAMMER ON MNF! Ha ha, you‚Äôre dead now. Thanks for playing though. Our boy JG went primetime this week. Braveheart was a rare bright spot for the deeply shitty Browns in their blowout loss to Holy Shit Are They Good Now Or Have They Just Not Really Played Anyone Yet Niners. While all around him crumbled, Gilly was consistently booming punt after punt into the night sky. You wanna know how big his Scottish Tree of a Leg is? He had a **Touchback** kicking from the **Cleveland 29 yard** line. *Seventy-one fucken yards ya wee fucking jobbies! Thass soom fucken hammertime fer ya.*

# Bad Week for

1. **AJ Cole III (OAK, -10 to #31).** This week, Lord Abercrombie Jacquelin Cole III got on a plane and went to London. *London?* LONDON! Bad food, worse weather, Mary Fucking Poppins, LONDON. And in London, bad punting happened. On the first drive of the game, the Raiders Incognito‚Äôd themselves out of field goal range and had Cole punt on **4th and 18 from the 36 yard line**. Touchback, net 16 yards. Two punts later, returner/human cloud of smoke Tarik Cohen **weaved one back for 71 yards. Net -28 yards**. Four punts in total, one touchback, **19.9 NAY**, -10 places in the Punt Rankings. Cole and the Raiders now lead the league in most punt return yards given up (**176 through 5 weeks**) and over **63%** of Cole‚Äôs punts have been returned (ranking **33rd of 36**). All in all, not a good trip old boy. Pip pip.
2. **Colby Wadman (DEN, -8 to #23).** Hey waddayaknow‚Ä¶ The Broncos won! Well, all of them except Colby. Colby definitely lost. Punting from his own 17, Wadman hit one high and handsome to Desmond King who duly said Hi and Bye scampered back **68 yards for the score**. Throw in a touchback on a 46 yard boot to the endzone and it‚Äôs an ugly day; **four punts at 23.5 NAY** and a further slide for Wadders.  
3. **Tress Way (WSH, -2 to #7).** Goodnight sweet prince. After an entire season last year without a touchback (only the third punting season of all time to do so), Tress finally became mortal again this week with a 62 yarder that      snuck into the endzone. **10 punts** (on 15 drives!!) for Tress and this fuckawful Redskins team: 1 sad and lonely touchback, **658 days since his last one**. Still the MVP of our hearts.

# Punt of the week ‚Äì Week 5

Sometimes you need your punter to come up clutch. This week, **Michael Palardy (CAR)** was the guy. The Panthers had got themselves into a hearty ding dong with GOATner and his Jags, but late in the fourth quarter they recovered a Minshew ~~Magic~~ Misery fumble inside the Jags half to put the game to bed, or so they thought. Instead, with one-man-offensive-machine CMC on the sidelines, the Panthers somehow spluttered to a halt at **4th and 12 on the Jags 39** at the with 1:51 on the clock. This left a 58 yard field goal to make it a two score game, and Joey Slye has already missed from 56, so out came Palardy for the punt. And what a punt it was. Right hand side of the field, one hop, **out of bounds at the 5**. Net gain of just **34 yards**, but it gave the Jags 95 yards to go with only one timeout and not much on the clock. And, to the Jags' credit, they almost made it. Minshew‚Äôs 00:00 throw came up a few yards short of the endzone allowing Luke Kuechly to bat it away and seal the win. If Palardy had played it any safer‚Ä¶ well. That‚Äôs why you love your punter.

# Mitch Wishnowsky Zero Return Yard Watch

Guys we did it! We went negative! Mitch went into Monday Night Football at 0 return yards through four weeks (Week 4 was a bye but who‚Äôs counting), and somehow came out even better. Two fair catches and a 60 yarder downed at the 18 saw him well into the fourth quarter with his streak intact. Lining up at his own 16 with 07:17 left on the clock in the fourth, Mitch missiled a boot out past midfield where OBJ was waiting to return with field out in front of him. My heart was in my mouth‚Ä¶ Beckham zigged left. He zagged right. He stopped dead still. [He turned around and ran directly towards his own endzone](https://imgur.com/a/o7bKTzD) as shit started to get pretty weird. His casual dangling of the ball by his right hip was no match for a swinging punch, and suddenly the ball was loose and underneath a pile of jubilant Niners. **-6 return yards**, a turnover, and Wishnowsky Watch rolls on to Week 6 against the Rams.

p.s. can we talk about him fielding that bobbled snap and still getting it 40 yards downfield while punting on the run? Dang, son.

Very amateurish breakdown of each team and their needs,"Im bored so heres some very flawed and mediocre content

It's gonna be mainly focused on starters

&#x200B;

AFC East:

\-Patriots: Cornerbacks and safeties are great. Dline is great. Linebackers im pretty sure? are really good. Running backs are deep as shit and WR's have been turned into a strength for the team. Dont shit about their tight ends, and oline is seemingly lacking in depth and a little banged up. QB is a no name scrub.

Possible needs: oline depth

\-Jets: Good safeties, decent corners I think, solid Dline that seems to be on the come up. Dont know much about the lb's. O line has been a nightmare for poor ol falk, dont know much about te's, RB is top 5, and wr's could use some work but not terrible.

Possible Needs:  WR, OL, maybe lb? te?

\-Bills: Great Dline, great linebackers, great cornerbacks and great safeties. Killer fuckin defense. Oline is on the come up i feel like- cody ford's been an impressive rookie. Dawson knox is a revelation at TE, wr's are solid but can use some work. RB's aren't bad but could maybe use a little boost. QB's good and young with upside.

Possible needs:  WR

Dolphins: Haha oh man, these guys. I dont even fucking know. Xavien howard is awesome but he's probably gonna be traded right? Christian wilkins is a good rookie. Rb's are pretty good, drake is a beast. WR's are decent. Oline needs some major work. I like rosen.  dont know about lb's

Possible needs: all over the damn board but primarily OL, maybe lb and maybe DL. Also secondary, lol

&#x200B;

AFC West:

\-Chargers: Elite Dline, Elite secondary, even with derwin out. When he's back, wew. Good (?) linebackers I believe. Dont know much about the oline, but rivers is great, wide receivers are great and running backs are great. Hunter henry is a great TE.

Possible needs: maybe OL and maybe LBs? Also need to start thinking about rivers replacement quite soon

\-Chiefs: Why these two teams in a row? Theyre both ""ch"" teams. Int it obvious? Pretty good Dline, idk about lb's, some good players scattered in secondary but overall the unit needs work. Oline is good, wide receivers are great, rb's are really good and TE is maybe the best in the league. Patrick mahomes is a demigod.

Needs: secondary help for sure. Probably CB

\-Raiders: OL's been playing solid i believe? WR's are subpar, josh jacobs is an awesome young RB, and waller's been a revelation at TE. Dline is pretty good, linebackers idk (you might see this being a trend), gareon conley is a lockdown corner, and safeties are pretty good.

Needs:  WR for sure, LB? Maybe qb, if derek carr isnt cutting it? Honestly the team's pretty good

\-Broncos: OL im pretty sure has been good but im not super confident, sutton's good and so is sanders but probably wouldnt hurt to draft a WR, rb's are great, TE is great and young. Dline is really good, linebackers i have no idea lmao i think i saw one high up on pff so there you go hahaha. CHJ is an elite corner but theres word about him being possibly traded. Dont know much about the safeties. Flacco's serviceable and lock doesnt inspire that much confidence but we'll see

Needs: WR, CB maybe lb?

&#x200B;

AFC North:

\-Steelers: Oline's great, QB situation has been unfortunate but mason rudolph is going to be quite good in the future, WR""s are looking real good, RB is really good. TE""s good too. Dline is quite good, lb's are pretty good, particularly devin bush. CB are improving? Safeties are good.

Needs: This is an interesting one, maybe some depth on dline and a lockdown corner

\-Browns: Shit oline. Holding this team back a ton. Baker's still good despite the poor performances, WR's are elite, rb is elite, and TE is good. Dline is great, lb's are solid, CB's should be lockdown but theyre young so maybe some growing pains, and idk about the safeties.

Needs: O L I N E. Maybe lb. Maybe safety?

Ravens: Oline seems to be playing great. Marquise brown has been much needed at WR and has honestly rejuvenated their offense. Lamar is a monster. RB's are really good. Dline is decent, lb's idk, safeties are good and CB's are very good. TE's are good too.

Needs: Maybe WR depth and probably Dline

Bengals: Oh bungles. Im not sure about the oline, very unfortunate about jonah williams absence, maybe he'll make it better when hes back. WR's are really good but the team's wasting poor aj's career. RB's are really good. TE is good.  Dline is decent i think? LB needs help, safeties IDK and theyve got some talent at CB.

Needs: LB, maybe safety, maybe oline, maybe dline. I dont know the roster that well off the top of my head I guess! But hey at least marvin lewis is gone. It's like the shackles have been removed and yall can make forward progress now.

&#x200B;

AFC South:

Jaguars: MINSHEW THE GOD. Lol i watched this dude at wsu and I love him. Jags are in pretty good hands moving forward. Oline's decent? WR's are decent but can use a clear #1. Rb's are real good. TE idk. Dline should be elite but has been underperforming. Lb's are great, cb's are elite, safeties im not sure.

Needs: WR, maybe oline? maybe safety

Texans: Watson's awesome. Oline's been improving, wr's are borderline elite, rb's are serviceable, idk about TE. Dline is very good, lb's idk, safety is good and cb's are good i think.

Needs: RB, maybe TE, maybe oline and safety? Not sure but this is a good team

Titans: Mariota's good, make no mistake about it. Underperforming oline. Good wr's, good rbs, good TE. Very good dline, good lb's, good corner and great safeties.

Needs: Oline

Colts: Brissetts good but is he a franchise qb? Oline is elite. Rbs are good just not well known. WR's are real good. TE is good. Dline is good, linebackers are v good, darius leonard is elite. CB is good i think, hooker is an elite safety.

Needs: QB to develop, sexy RB

&#x200B;

NFC East:

Redskins: Im doing this team first because we just talked about forward progress lol. Poor skins fans, fuck dan snyder. Anyway, oline is solid i think? Scary terry's been a beast but they could prob use another wr. RB's are good. TE's good when healthy. Dline's pretty damn good, lb's idk, safeties are good? and cb's arent bad? Excited to see haskins

Needs: WR, maybe secondary?

Cowboys: Dak's been real good. WR's are real good. Oline is real good. RB is real good (i wouldve said elite but i had to keep the real good going). Dline is real good, LB's are real good (elite). CB's are real good, and safeties are solid. Oh and TE is decrepit but good.

Needs: TE, maybe safety but im not sure

Giants: My best buddy's favorite team so I feel your team's struggles deeply. Oline has been not bad? TE is really good, Running back is legit the best in the league. This guy is just insane to watch. WR's need some heavy help. Dline's decent but needs some more edge presence. LB's are okay? CB's are good and have a lot of young depth, safeties are decent. Daniel jones has a lot of promise

Needs: WR, Edge (ik about oshane ximines but hes not enough)

Eagles: Wentz is borderline elite, oline is super good, WR's are decent but need some work, rb's are pretty damn good. TE's are elite. Dline is very good, lbs idk, got orlando scandrick which is nice but secondary as a whole needs some shoring up.

Needs: WR and secondary

&#x200B;

NFC West:

Seahawks: Oline has been? I dont really know. Decent? Okay? WR's are real good, dk metcalf is gonna be scary. RB's are quite good, and TE is good. Dline is pretty good, lbs are elite (well bobby wagner is), cbs are eh and safeties are eh. Dont feel i need to mention wilson, dude is magic

Needs: This team is a couple key pieces from being very elite, hope pete carroll doesnt notice.

Cardinals: On the come up. Kyler murray is good and can fucking RUN. I wish he ran the 40. Dude's very promising. Oline is bad. WR's are pretty decent and got a nice young core. RB is great. TE's im not sure. Dline has chandler jones and not much else i believe. Lbs are okay? CBs are pretty good and safeties are pretty good.

Needs: Team's drafted well, should be coming up soon. Oline is a need.

49ers: Oline is good but banged up a bit, jimmy g's good. RB's are killing it, WR's are not well known but honestly quite good. TE is elite. Dline is elite, lb's are good, secondary has good players scattered about but has holes.

Needs: Secondary

Rams: MY BOYS. I know this team in and out, baby. Oline is bad but I think the new guys will get it together. Still desperately needs work though. Despite what some people might say or have said in the past, im very happy with our TE's. Our WR core might be the best in the league and im quite comfortable in saying that. RB has gurley looking pretty good, browns a great backup and I reaaaally want to see what henderson can do. Ive always had a problem with gurley in that hes not very shifty, but whatever. Dline is really good, borderline elite. Donald is a god, clay has been amazing (RIP for 5 weeks), fowlers really good, ebukam is solid, brockers is decent, SJD is serviceable. Cant wait to finally see what Obo can do with clay out. CB's are quite good but we might lose peters and talib this offseason which would be a big problem.  We'll see if david long was the lockdown CB he was in college. Safeties are great, I love talyor rapp and JJIII is a star. Kinda wish we drafted a free safety since it wouldve made more sense since we already have JJ at SS but we needed the tackling help Rapp provides so im thrilled with him.  LB's need help, littletons awesome and one of the best in the league imo. IF we keep him, that spot is locked down and safe. But that other spot needs help, bryce hager is just not gonna cut it (why the fuck is troy reeder on our roster and NOT dakota allen) Im not worried about goff one bit. Dude's 24 and is gonna be a monster in his prime with mcvay. His oline is ranked last and he's still been decent. If anything this will be a good learning experience for him and really toughen and sharpen him up (if it doesnt destroy his health)

Needs: Oline, possibly CB, and LB

&#x200B;

NFC North:

Lions: I see you lions. Good oline, good wr's, good rbs, great young TE. Great, maybe elite Dline, idk lb's, great corner, idk about safeties. Stafford's real good.

Needs: S? Lbs?

Vikings: Kirk's been disappointing but I think he'll be fine. Olines very much improving. Wr's are elite, rb is elite, TE is real good. Dline is borderline elite, lb's are good and secondary is good as a whole. Vikings have always been a talented team.

Needs: Oline depth, maybe lb? idk

Packers: Rodgers is rodgers, oline's been real good, rb's are real good, wr's are real good. TE's good too. Dline has been elite i think, lb's are good, and secondary is good with some holes maybe at safety.

Needs: Maybe safety? im actually not even sure about that, this is a really good team. maybe wr but not even tbh

Bears: Trubisky isnt good and thats generous. yall can give him more time but its not looking good as of rn. Oline is good? im actually not sure. Wr's are decent, RBs are really good. Idk about TE. Dline is elite and maybe the best in the league, lb's are elite, cb's are really good and safeties are elite.

Needs: WR, maybe oline? And i hate to say it, but probably qb

&#x200B;

NFC South:

Saints: Brees is brees and bridgewater has been awesome in his place. Oline is good. WR's are real good. RB is elite. TE is real good. Dline is very very good, borderline elite. Lbs idk, cb's are really good and so are safeties.

Needs: maybe lb? maybe a brees replacement if the team decides not to roll with brees. Good team with not many holes

Buccaneers: Jameis is an enigma. I think he's good. Rb's are looking pretty good, oline has been decent, wr's are verrrry good, and TE is very good. Dline is extremely good, idk about elite but theyre great. LB's are great, secondary has some talented players and some definite holes.

Needs: Secondary, idk specifically

Panthers: Man idk what's going on with cam, dude's a shell of his former self. Kyle allen's good though. CMC is a fucking monster. Oline's decent. WR's are okay but maybe need some help. TE's good but old. DLine is VERY good. Lb's are elite, cb's are good, safeties are good.

Needs: WR, TE and I hate to see it happen to cam but QB is becoming a problem.

Falcons: No offense but i really just dont like watching this team. Theres something about it that i cant put my finger on. Matt ryan's great, oline is young so we'll see how they do in the future, rb's are good, wr's are elite, TE is good. Dline is decent, lb's are really good, safeties are decent and cb's idk.

Needs: Maybe RB, CB, and maaaaybe oline depth

"The worst QB rating in a win, and the best QB rating in a loss, for every team (2010-2019)","So I was inspired by a reply from Baldy on the AMA yesterday to see how well a QB's passer rating in a game correlates with getting a win. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ueKGml8) is what I found from 2010 to 2019. As you might guess, win percentage and passer rating are pretty well correlated. But the thing that interested me most is the fact that a few QBs won the game with rating below 40, and some lost with a rating above 120. Here is the list of the worst single-game passer ratings in a win and the best single-game passer ratings for a loss, from 2010 to 2019 (min. 15 attempts).

How Does The Pink Visor Help?,"I've seen people post about this a few times here and there so wanted to share.

&#x200B;

The pink lens some QBs are wearing in games this season (as advertised by Oakley in the personal optics industry as a PRIZM GOLF) is recommended for golfers, soccer players and really anyone who needs glasses for sunny and mixed lighting conditions where they see a lot of green, ie. grass. There are other color lenses for other purposes - but the pink lens is specifically designed to increase contrast and clarity against green backdrops and blue skies.   


Oakley designed the PRIZM lenses using a finely tuned spectrometer and special dyes which were injected into the lenses. The best analogy is a speaker system - most sunglasses just make it lighter or darker; volume up or volume down.

What Oakley did is engineer various types of dyes to block out specific wavelengths of light. This is like the EQ on a high quality sound system - now you aren't just changing volume, you are increasing treble, decreasing bass. You can design a sound system to fit a specific room's needs, just as Oakley could now design lenses for specific activities. Oakley then studied the lighting conditions encountered in various sports, observing the specific wavelengths of light athletes are experiencing and tailoring lenses to those conditions specifically. The pink lens for instance increases contrast among greens, originally designed to help golfers differentiate between different types of grass. It also allows for better clarity and makes it easier to gauge distance. All very important things in golf, but very important in football as well. 

&#x200B;

Seeing is believing though. You can click the below link to play a video where it will show you what the PRIZM lens does. Click to play and once playing, click and hold to see it through the PRIZM lens

 [https://www.oakley.com/en-us/prizm/golf](https://www.oakley.com/en-us/prizm/golf) 

&#x200B;

To get into a little more technical detail: most PRIZM lenses work by blocking out specific wavelengths of light where there is overlap in the light cones in our eyes. We see millions of colors but have three types of color cones in our eyes - what this means is to distinguish some colors, we are utilizing two types of cones. This is especially true of greens and greens shifting towards the red spectrum, such as brown shades. Cutting out some of the light in the specific wavelength of the most overlap provides greater visual acuity by allowing each individual cone to distinguish it's specific color range.   


 [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg) 

In the above image we see the wavelengths each cone can distinguish. Notice the large amount of overlap centered around the green and lighter brown shades. You cut back some of those wavelengths and the other wavelengths around them become more prominent because one type of cone (the M-cones, to be specific)  can pick up the more green hues and the other type of cone can pick up the more reddish, brown hues (the L-cones). That's why when you look at the grass in the video on the Oakley page and see it through the PRIZM lens, it picks up a lot more browns. The lens removes all the ""muddled"" colors where those two cones are both perceiving light. The areas that become brown when the PRIZM is activated in the video, start off looking almost over-exposed. The areas look ""bright"" because two types of cones are picking up color. Essentially the PRIZM lens simply de-exposes those areas by limiting the wavelengths where there is overlap, allowing us to distinguish minute differences more clearly. It's really cool technology and it really works!

"What is the best Special Team trio (main returner, kicker, punter) in NFL history?","I was watching old Bears highlights, and Hester was just unfair at times with how he could flip field position and change games with one return. Meanwhile having younger Gould as well, who's still a top 5 most accurate kickers, it's a shame I took that kind of production for granted given recent events. 

It kind of let me to this unique question, but what do you think is the greatest special teams trio (or quartet if KR and PR are different) in NFL history? Not necessarily team success but moreso individual talent.


(P.S. Brad Maynard was our punter during the Hester-Gould years and I don't watch Brad Maynard highlight videos, but he wasn't bad so I'd definitely say the 06-07 Bears are up there.)",36,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dg0hnc/what_is_the_best_special_team_trio_main_returner/,3190.3978928844135,r/nfl

[OC] Visualization of Average QBR by Age. 2009 vs 2019,"Sharing what I thought was an interesting comparison of average QBR by age of the QB during the 2009 and 2019 seasons.

https://i.redd.it/e45pmspiaqr31.png

It is clear that younger quarterbacks in 2019 are performing at a higher level. Also interesting - is that there seems to be a clear pattern of improvement with age in 2009. See the graph below with a support line on 2009 data. 2009 was a year where QB's were clearly ""better with age.""

"""Sacked"" records on the line this year","Cardinals rookie Kyler Murray started at a mad rate for being sacked, same with some other teams put up an early rate of putting up sacks on their opponents.  

But since then they have dropped to normal margins, but then i noticed something, Luke Faulk already has been sacked 16 times. 

Jets have already gone through many QBs, sure Carr got hit a lot in his record year, but other bad O-lines manage to kill their QB and then their back-ups take the sacks, let alone garbage time sacks, so perhaps a team stat is higher?

So i looked up the stats and jets. also a game back of everyone else due to buy week are getting sacked at a 5.8/a game

So i looked [back](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/qb-sacked-per-game?date=2019-10-10) and the 2014 bucks have a 4.4/game rate, worst in the records i looked at that went back to 2003.

Also of note, the current titans and dolphins also match and surpass that notoriously bad online of the 2014 bucs, in that order.

 So looking at Sacks as a team stat over a QB stat shows so interesting things. It would be interesting if anyone has better data, or data that better organized the data per teams on sacks.

As a follow-up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/ddsmuz/the_last_time_each_team_was_undefeated/), where I got a number of requests for the opposite table.

^1 History time.  In the mid-1940s, a lot of players (and other player-aged people) served in WWII, so there was a dearth of NFL players.  The Pittsburgh Steelers were unable to field an entire team, so they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1943, as a team known affectionately as the Steagles.  In 1944, the Steelers again were short players, so they merged with the Chicago Cardinals that season.  This team was known as Card-Pitt, or derisively as the ""carpets"" because they were so bad.  It is that 0-10 team that you see here.

Some interesting items of note:

* The Baltimore Ravens are the only team to never have gone 0-4.  You may recall from the other post that the Ravens are also one of the three teams to never have gone 5-0.

* The Denver Broncos have never gone 0-5, but they were really pushing it this season.

* I would like to apologize in advance to the Cleveland Browns.  The previous table showing win streaks did them no favors and the table showing losing streaks makes them look bad, too.  But, hey, at least your 2017 season hides your 2016 season, right?


EDIT: By request, here is the same chart, but excluding the 2019 season.

Team|0-1|0-2|0-3|0-4|0-5|0-6|0-7|0-8|0-9|0-10|0-11|0-12|0-13|0-14|0-15|0-16

Take a look at his last 20 games with the Raiders compared to his FOURTEEN games with the Cowboys. On 6 less games he's thriving. His projected sets a great line for a WR1 for Dallas.

Play Selection While Under Center And In Shotgun Formation,"https://www.sharpfootballstats.com/snap-rates--shotgun-v-under-center--off-.html

Stumbled across this neato little tool that shows how often a team runs or passes out of shotgun and under center. At a little over a quarter of the through the season trends are setting and it's fun to look at what teams are doing this year. 


*  Holy Moly Sean McVay. I thought passing 98% of the time out of shotgun may be because of Gurley or a bit of an outlier. Nope. 97% last year. Crazy that he is almost guaranteed to pass out of that formation and still lights up the defense. 


*  Baltimore with that 3% of snaps under center is pretty crazy.

Thrilled to see Brissett on this list. He's been so steady and solid for the Colts. Keeping them out of negative plays and ahead of the chains in most situations is all it's going to take  to make them competitive in most games. There's so much talent surrounding him and outstanding coaching.

"[Serious] If the Patriots lost that playoff Snow Bowl to The Raiders, who wins SB 36?","Let‚Äôs say Vinatieri misses that 45 yard FG in the snow, which would have made the Tuck Rule a moot point.

Assuming the Rams still beat the Eagles in the NFC CG, who wins a Raiders/Steelers AFC CG and could either of those teams have replicated what the Pats did in that SB?

Oakland was a very talented team, but they were suspect against the run in 2001, Pittsburgh was a great running team, and a West Coast team playing in an early kickoff would have been potentially tricky (this was the last year the the early CG had a 12:30 PM start time).

Pittsburgh had Kordell Stewart who had a comeback year, but was prone to poorly timed playoff turnovers. OTOH, was Oakland‚Äôs defense good enough to force him into one of those types of games.

When these teams did meet up in real life in week 2 2002, Rich Gannon had a 43-64 403 yard night. Could the Raiders talented offense have replicated a similar situation in the playoffs?

In real life, Pittsburgh was a 10 point favorite and seemed to take the Patriots too lightly a week after beating division rival and then-defending SB champ Baltimore. Had they faced Oakland, might the Steelers have taken Oakland a bit more seriously?

Regardless of who wins that game, given how surprising New England‚Äôs run was, I don‚Äôt think the Rams would have been a two touchdown favorite over Oakland or Pittsburgh in Super Bowl 36. 

Before kickoff, expectations were that the Rams would rout the Patriots, which may have fed into Martz and company being overconfident and perhaps taking them too lightly in a way I think they might not have been against the Raiders or Steelers. (Perhaps a 5-6 point favorite at most IMO)

In real life SB 36, the Pats defense hit hard and playing very physical with the Greatest Show on Turf. Given how good Pittsburgh‚Äôs defense was in 2001 (#3 scoring defense, fewest yards allowed, #4 pass defense, #1 rush defense), could they have been as similarly physical with the Rams WR? I feel the Steeler defense was tough and talented enough to play that same punishing style against Warner and their skill position players.

Martz infamously did not give Marshall Faulk enough carries (17 vs the Pats), but the Steeler defense was hard to run against and the Raiders were easy to run against

And do you think Gruden or Cowher could have won the coaching matchup with Martz?

Lastly, the Pats came out onto the field in pregame as a team. Had they not been there, do we still have the individual pregame intros?",38,0.51,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dfnaw0/serious_if_the_patriots_lost_that_playoff_snow/,4359.047894632817,r/nfl

"If you were a defensive coordinator, how would you gameplan against Mahomes?","Some quarterbacks have exploitable weaknesses. The giants in 2007 and the Broncos in 2015 beat Brady by pressuring and hitting him all game long, and their secondaries rose to the occasion and covered the Pats receivers like glue. It‚Äôs very hard to do, but that‚Äôs the only way defenses have stopped Brady.

Although Mahomes lost to the Colts, defenses prior to that game haven‚Äôt really been able to stop him. Whenever the chiefs lose it was simply because they got outscored. What are some ways defenses can shut down Mahomes? Is it to play cover 3/cover 4 a lot to stop him from using possibly his greatest gift, his top 10 all time arm? He exceptional at throwing on the run, (a trait he shares with Russell Wilson) so is blitzing a lot a good strategy? He also has drawn comparisons to Brett Favre for his arm strength and Aaron Rodgers‚Äô playmaking ability. However he has already shown superior judgement to Favre, he really doesn‚Äôt make many mistakes. In fact, possibly his biggest flaw so far is him going for unnecessary spectacular plays, for example when he missed a wide open Kelce in the endzone just because he was attempting his signature no-look pass.

Fooutball Outsider's Offensive and Defensive efficiency.,"[Offense](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamoff/2019)

[Defense](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2019)


I started getting into these rankings as I watched Cousins go for 4,000 and Diggs and Theilen a 1,000 each, but the offense still looked like shit and the team wasn't winning. Getting past the raw stats and looking into team efficiency gives a better idea of team talent and this is perfect tool for it. Here are a few tid bit's I found a little interesting. 


*  Seattle is 3rd in offensive efficiency and is doing it without being top 5 in yards for a QB, WR, or RB. 

*  Good to see dick nosed DeFillipo learned a lesson. He was bottom 5-10 in almost every category last year and has the Jags looking good at 7th overall. 


*  Cleveland at 29th on offense should have Browns fans worried about the play-calling ans scheme as much as anything else. 



*  Steelers with the the 7th most efficient defense and Jet's with the 10th is a bit of a surprise and should give a little hope to a couple grumpy fan bases. 


*  Miami is almost twice as bad as the 31st ranked team. That's fucking nuts. 


*  Ravens, Jags, and Colts coming in at 24th, 25th, and 26th in defensive efficiency is another surprise.

This week gives us four divisional matchups and the number of bye teams also increases to four, so just 14 games to watch. Let's get to it!

---

Winner||Loser|Comments
-|-|-|-
[](/NE) Patriots | over | [](/NYG) Giants | Sorry, Giants fans, but we're not in the Super Bowl in this matchup. As much as everyone in New York is warming up to Jones, the Dark Lord just sees him as a young sacrifice to the old gods to continue his reign of undefeated terror.
[](/CAR) Panthers | over | [](/TB) Buccaneers | CMC is proving to be a great Newton replacement for the face of the franchise. But despite the Bucs' loss last week, they were able to slow down the run game very well, so I'm not sure if Carolina will be able to utilize CMC and Allen may have to resort to the passing game. Panthers by less than a field goal.
[](/SEA) Seahawks | over | [](/CLE) Browns | Is the Cleveland Hype Train falling off the rails? How many times do the Browns have to keep getting punched in the mouth before we admit that Baker's going through a huge second-year slump and that Kitchens is hot garbage? Wilson will show them how it's done and give the Browns yet another loss.
[](/KC) Chiefs | over | [](/HOU) Texans | This is a good one. KC is facing another good AFC South team and this one is arguably better than Indy. I wouldn't be surprised by another loss, but I think the Chiefs pull it back together and get back to winning.
[](/WAS) Redskins | over | [](/MIA) Dolphins | Tank Bowl 2019! It's reasonable to say that Washington without Gruden is about even with the Dolphins after their bye. You know how people slow down to look at a bad car wreck? That's this game.
[](/MIN) Vikings | over | [](/PHI) Eagles | Man, Cousins showed up last week and help give Minnesota a solid win. If they can keep that up, then there's a good chance they can win again at home against Philly.
[](/NO) Saints | over | [](/JAX) Jaguars | Looks like Minshew gets to go up against another NFC South backup QB. And I think the results will be the same. the Jaguar's defense will keep them honest, but I can see Teddy airing it out once again on a team where Ramsey will be absent due to ""back spasms"". Love me some Fournette and Chark, though. Geaux Tigers!
[](/BAL) Ravens | over | [](/CIN) Bengals | Good Lord, please let this be a decent game. This has the potential to be a slaughter, so I just hope that Cincy can put enough points on the board to make it interesting.
[](/SF) 49ers | over | [](/LAR) Rams | If you told me that at this time in the season the Rams would have two losses and the 49ers were undefeated, I would've requested you be admitted to the mental ward. Granted, the 49ers have yet to play a team with a winning record, and we all remember what happened to Dallas once they faced the Saints. This is another game to watch.
[](/ARI) Cardinals | over | [](/ATL) Falcons | Going purely off of previous games, both teams are sitting at 20 points per game, but Arizona is slightly better at 27 points allowed versus Atlanta's 30. Both teams are hot garbage, but at least the Cardinals have a learning rookie QB as their excuse.
[](/TEN) Titans | over | [](/DEN) Broncos | Again, going off of stats, both teams are at around 19 points per game, but Tennessee is better at points allowed with 15, compared to Denver's 21. 
[](/DAL) Cowboys | over | [](/NYJ) Jets | Finally, after two weeks the Cowboys can face another team with a losing record that they have a chance of beating! But watch out! Sam Darnold doesn't have mono anymore, and he could be just the thing to give the Jets their first win.
[](/LAC) Chargers | over | [](/PIT) Steelers | Man, you have to feel horrible with Pittsburgh's countless injuries. But I don't think the Chargers will care much, as they look to take advantage of this to grab a home win.
[](/GB) Packers | over | [](/DET) Lions | I think this will be a close one. MNF divisional game. Packers are hot and the Lions are off a bye and well-rested. Should be an awesome showdown.

**Byes:** [](/BUF) Bills, [](/CHI) Bears, [](/IND) Colts, [](/OAK) Raiders

The standings/picks spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-T5AOdkCVug36eMdHj-YWCNyvpjnSg0gvsHlST8oBGk/edit?usp=sharing). Last week's picks thread is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dcc8f1/rnfl_scoring_game_week_4_standings_week_5_picks/).

1. u/Butkus69 - 216 points

2. u/NopeNotGonnaAnswer - 200 points

3. Two people tied with 198 points

The most popular pick last week was the **Philadelphia Eagles**, taken by 26% of participants. They scored 31 points against the New York Jets. The second most popular pick was the **Kansas City Chiefs**, taken 17.6% of participants. They scored 13 points against the Indianapolis Colts.

The highest scoring team last week was the **Houston Texans**, who scored 53 points against the Atlanta Falcons. 6% of participants took the Texans. They are also the **Best Value Pick of the Week**.

The lowest scoring team was the **Cleveland Browns**, who only scored 3 points against the San Francisco 49ers. Only 3 people took the Browns.

**Bust Pick of the Week**: The Kansas City Chiefs, who might be the bust pick of the year so far. I don't think any of the 17.6% of people who took them expected only 13 points against the Colts.

**Week 6 Picks**

Reminder: **You cannot pick the same team twice. If you do, your pick will not be counted for that week. Please check the spreadsheet if you're unsure about if you've already taken a particular team.**

NFL Week 6 Predictions Thread (2019 Season),"Good morning /r/NFL! Hope your week is going well. We've seen some good football the last five weeks, hopefully we'll see some more this week. Only two undefeated teams remain, maybe we'll start seeing some parity this week, who knows. Last week, I was able to improve to 10-5, bringing me to 48-30. Please share how you're doing so far. This week gives us four divisional matchups and the number of bye teams also increases to four, so just 14 games to watch. Let's get to it!

---

Winner||Loser|Comments
-|-|-|-
[](/NE) Patriots | over | [](/NYG) Giants | Sorry, Giants fans, but we're not in the Super Bowl in this matchup. As much as everyone in New York is warming up to Jones, the Dark Lord just sees him as a young sacrifice to the old gods to continue his reign of undefeated terror.
[](/CAR) Panthers | over | [](/TB) Buccaneers | CMC is proving to be a great Newton replacement for the face of the franchise. But despite the Bucs' loss last week, they were able to slow down the run game very well, so I'm not sure if Carolina will be able to utilize CMC and Allen may have to resort to the passing game. Panthers by less than a field goal.
[](/SEA) Seahawks | over | [](/CLE) Browns | Is the Cleveland Hype Train falling off the rails? How many times do the Browns have to keep getting punched in the mouth before we admit that Baker's going through a huge sophomore slump and that Kitchens is hot garbage? Wilson will show them how it's done and give the Browns yet another loss.
[](/KC) Chiefs | over | [](/HOU) Texans | This is a good one. KC is facing another good AFC South team and this one is arguably better than Indy. I wouldn't be surprised by another loss, but I think the Chiefs pull it back together and get back to winning.
[](/WAS) Redskins | over | [](/MIA) Dolphins | Tank Bowl 2019! It's reasonable to say that Washington without Gruden is about even with the Dolphins after their bye. You know how people slow down to look at a bad car wreck? That's this game.
[](/MIN) Vikings | over | [](/PHI) Eagles | Man, Cousins showed up last week and help give Minnesota a solid win. If they can keep that up, then there's a good chance they can win again at home against Philly.
[](/NO) Saints | over | [](/JAX) Jaguars | Looks like Minshew gets to go up against another NFC South backup QB. And I think the results will be the same. the Jaguar's defense will keep them honest, but I can see Teddy airing it out once again on a team where Ramsey will be absent due to ""back spasms"". Love me some Fournette and Chark, though. Geaux Tigers!
[](/BAL) Ravens | over | [](/CIN) Bengals | Good Lord, please let this be a decent game. This has the potential to be a slaughter, so I just hope that Cincy can put enough points on the board to make it interesting.
[](/SF) 49ers | over | [](/LAR) Rams | If you told me that at this time in the season the Rams would have two losses and the 49ers were undefeated, I would've requested you be admitted to the mental ward. Granted, the 49ers have yet to play a team with a winning record, and we all remember what happened to Dallas once they faced the Saints. This is another game to watch.
[](/ARI) Cardinals | over | [](/ATL) Falcons | Going purely off of previous games, both teams are sitting at 20 points per game, but Arizona is slightly better at 27 points allowed versus Atlanta's 30. Both teams are hot garbage, but at least the Cardinals have a learning rookie QB as their excuse.
[](/TEN) Titans | over | [](/DEN) Broncos | Again, going off of stats, both teams are at around 19 points per game, but Tennessee is better at points allowed with 15, compared to Denver's 21. 
[](/DAL) Cowboys | over | [](/NYJ) Jets | Finally, after two weeks the Cowboys can face another team with a losing record that they have a chance of beating! But watch out! Sam Darnold doesn't have mono anymore, and he could be just the thing to give the Jets their first win.
[](/LAC) Chargers | over | [](/PIT) Steelers | Man, you have to feel horrible with Pittsburgh's countless injuries. But I don't think the Chargers will care much, as they look to take advantage of this to grab a home win.
[](/GB) Packers | over | [](/DET) Lions | I think this will be a close one. MNF divisional game. Packers are hot and the Lions are off a bye and well-rested. Should be an awesome showdown.

**Byes:** [](/BUF) Bills, [](/CHI) Bears, [](/IND) Colts, [](/OAK) Raiders

"Time of Possession: When it Works, When it Doesn't, and how it relates to Colts/Chiefs.","TL;DR - 

Long drives keeping an elite QB on the bench are a useful tool. By themselves they don't beat elite QBs though. You have to be efficient with your own possessions and your defense still has to force the opposing elite QB/offense to perform worse than they usually do. If you think your defense is up to the task though, then limiting the amount of possessions an elite offense get's is a great way to mitigate risk and is the main advantage of long TOP drives.

---

There has been quite an interesting debate on Time of Possession after the Chiefs/Colts game recently, and both sides of arguments I have seen seem to not understand what Time of Possession really does to a game.

There is really only one truth to what long drives do if there are enough of them in a game and that is that they **reduce the total amount of possessions in a game.**

Because the opposing team gets the ball back after a team scores/punts/turns it over (duh) the total possessions for each team will be within 1. However, if a game features many long drives then the amount of drives in a game will be reduced.

What does that mean for the old adage that was said about Brady/Manning/Brees/Rodgers and now Mahomes?

**It is correct...to a degree.** I'll explain further.

*(The following assumes the situation in the game is much like Chiefs/Colts, where one team is trying to shutdown an elite offense with an above average offense that can eat clock.)*

---

*1) You have to (usually) do more than just have a long drive.* 

I think this is the biggest point that is almost always never mentioned when talking about the strategy of ""making *insert elite QB* sit on the sidelines"".

Long drives are a good bet, but you have to capitalize on the drive.

What does that mean? Touchdowns. Only Touchdowns. If you are facing an elite QB that likely means their offense is at the least competent and at the most an elite unit. Sure reducing the amount of possessions in a game reduces the amount of expected points the other team can score, but that also reduces your own teams expected points scored.

Let's look at this a different way with some stats:

* Average Amount of Drives per Game for one team in 2018: 10.875 

* Average of Top 5 Offenses Points/Drive in 2018: 2.828

So in a normal game with the normal amount of possessions, **an elite offense from last year would score around 30.75 points, or 31.**

In relation to the Chiefs/Colts game, both teams had 9 non kneeling drives in the game. **If we do the same multiplication with 9 drives instead of 11 we get 25 points.** Way less scary, right?

You still reduce the amount of possessions your own team has, however. You're also theoretically playing an offense that scores at a higher rate than the rest of the league still. Both these things mean you have to get Touchdowns. Sounds like a John Madden quote, but it's true. 

For an extreme example of this in nfl history, [here is a game during the Peyton Manning years where the Colts possessed the ball for ~14 minutes and won.](https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009092100/2009/REG2/colts@dolphins) 

Even in the Colts/Chiefs game, with the Chiefs getting their shit beat in for the whole game, the Chiefs got the ball with 7:30 left in the 4th quarter down 16-10. This, I feel, is the main argument for people on the side of ""TOP doesn't matter"" point out. If both offenses in a game play to their normal levels, it won't matter if both teams have 2 possessions or 20, the offense that scores at a higher rate always wins.

This leads into my next point...

---

*2) You have to hold the other team below their average production still.* 

Just having long drives won't stop a good offense from being good.

Let's go back to the Colts/Chiefs. If the Chiefs scored at their normal pace for 2019 against the Colts, even with only 9 non kneeling drives, they still would've scored 28 points. Of course things don't quite work like that due to the butterfly effect, but the general point is that the defense usually still needs to perform great in a game with long drives.

This is definitely where long TOP draining drives kick in, however. **If a defense found a way to combat an elite offense, giving the elite offense less opportunities to figure it out in a game is a great strategy to putting a lid on the offenses potential.** This is definitely the biggest point of winning the TOP battle against elite offenses if your defense is putting up a great performance. Who is to say the Chiefs wouldn't explode in the 2 drives they lost to the Colts? It's hard to say, but we'll never know because of the Colts run game chewing clock.

---

*3) Long drives tiring out a defense might be a footballism, or might not.*

When you run a lot you get tired. We understand this. I understand it when I run on the treadmill for sure.

In reality, [there is data to support the idea that rest time doesn't affect defensive performance.](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2018/defense-and-rest-time)

While the other 2 points I present more of a ""concrete"" opinion, I don't really have one here. I think the article is interesting in that it goes against basic conventional wisdom of ""doing more work = get tired"". There have been a lot of football trueism's being debunked recently like ""When X team runs the ball 30 times they are 24-2"".

In general though, I think we forget that NFL players are peak athletes. They will get tired, but they do insane conditioning to prepare for it.

I would personally love more studies on this or interviews with players on this where they give serious answers instead of press conference answers.

---

I think both sides of the ""TOP matters/TOP doesn't matter"" have merit to their arguments. If they meet in the middle and realize why it does/doesn't matter then it would be good for the everyone's understanding.",35,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/df8glz/time_of_possession_when_it_works_when_it_doesnt/,5639.464563969771,r/nfl

Are the new helmets causing all these head injuries?,"With the new helmets and regulations that the NFL has put in place this year, it seems like there are way more head injuries and players being carted off than in the past. It could just be recency bias due to the season in full swing but it seems as though there are way more instances where players are getting hurt or having to be carried off on ""normal"" football plays. Whether its Mason Rudolph having to leave the game or Brandin Cooks getting knocked out just from hitting his head on the turf, at least from my point of view the new helmets are causing more and more severe head injuries.

Maybe Antonio Brown was right (lol) to have an issue with the new helmets because he cared about his own safety.",19,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/df574n/are_the_new_helmets_causing_all_these_head/,5865.581231466929,r/nfl
The All-Decade Playoff Picture (2010-2019),"Treating every team's regular season win/loss totals from 2010 to now as part of one big decade-long NFL season, we can piece together a playoff picture that's sort of a snapshot of the divisional dominators, major rivalries, has-beens and never-weres over the past ten years.

Here are the conference standings.

[NFC Standings](https://i.redd.it/3unjfhycedr31.png)

[AFC Standings](https://i.redd.it/nj32sypvgdr31.png)

Given the already large sample size, there isn't much potential for the picture to change drastically. Things that may yet swing include the ordering among the Cowboys, Eagles, Falcons, Panthers and perhaps Vikings; and the race among the Colts, Ravens, Broncos and Texans.

Though not yet technically eliminated, there's little hope for the Cardinals, 49ers, Lions, Bears, Bengals or Chargers to make their wild card bids.

If the all-decade playoffs were set today, these would be your match-ups for Wild Card weekend:

* Ravens @ Colts

\#||Team|Œî|Record|Comment						
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--						
1.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	--	|	5-0	|	New England's defense was one early play from perfect. Their offensive line still needs work, though the unit played much better in the second half. Things roll on for the Patriots at 5-0 as they prepare for the Giants and the short week. 
2.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	--	|	4-1	|	The Chiefs got out-coached on Sunday. The Colts showed how you play with injuries, and KC continued to act like they had no injuries. This allowed Cam Erving to almost get Mahomes killed and forced the entire offense to look out of sync. Andy Reid has gotten too drunk on what Mahomes can do and forgot he cannot run the same offense he wants when the Chiefs' WR1, WR2, and LT are out. Despite another poor day against the run, Kansas City's defense did do enough to win the game, so for the first time in a long while, the team lost because of their offense.
3.	| [](/NO) | Saints | 	+1	|	4-1	|	Perhaps the most important match of the Credence Bridgewater Revival tour was this division match against a tricky Bucs team. The defense backed up its strong showing against the Cowboys by blowing past the overpaid Bucs OL to sack Winston 6 times. Unfortunately, of the 204 passing yards allowed, 125 of those went to Godwin. This is becoming a bit of a strange pattern for the Saints, as they've held their opponents under 270 yards passing in 4 of their 5 games, but they have also allowed a 100-yard receiver in 3 of those games.
4.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	+2	|	4-1	|	Predicting how the Packers will fare in any given game continues to be difficult. The defense appeared unable to stop the run against the Eagles in week 4, and the offense couldn't play a full game, so it seemed like Zeke and the Cowboys would be a tough battle. Instead, the Packers offense - spearheaded by [people named Aaron](https://twitter.com/zachkruse2/status/1181224862783885314) - came out swinging and forced the Cowboys to pass, which became a buffet of turnovers for the Packers D. The Green Bay tradition of winning at AT&T Stadium continues. [See ya](https://i.imgur.com/LEZuqxe.gifv).
5.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	+2	|	4-1	|	In a wild battle featuring critical errors by both sides, a few key moments led to a narrow and fortunate victory for the good guys. Decked out in their sharpest duds, Quartermaster Wilson and Wing Reservist Lockett combined for an incredible passing maneuver early on, Reserve Brigadier Carson left his everyone breathless by juggling a grenade, and Specialist Tedric Thompson made a phenomenal interception of a critical message between the ovines. Even with all that, it took a sheep missing a clear shot to seal the victory. The Seattle crew will now fight some rambunctious elves that hide out in the Sadness Factory next to the flaming water.
6.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	+2	|	4-0	|	The Niners are 4-0 for the first time since 1990, and this win was on the back of the running back corps - scoring from the first offensive snap of the game and never ceding the lead. In the end, they gouged the Cleveland defense for 275 yards. The defense never let Baker get settled, sacking him 4 times and limiting him to only 100 yards passing for the game. Next week, they get their first big NFC West matchup against the Rams, favorites to win the division this year.
7.	| [](/LA) | Rams | 	-4	|	3-2	|	The Rams were on the short end of the stick in this game of inches, as they narrowly failed to convert on key chances to change the final outcome against the Seahawks. Currently on their first losing streak in the Sean McVay era, the Rams will look to be the hammer and give the 49ers their first test of the season.
8.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	+3	|	3-2	|	The Eagles took care of business against the inept Jets and now look forward to a difficult six game stretch through the end of November - @Vikings, @Cowboys, @Bills, vs. Bears, vs. Patriots, vs. Seahawks.  If the defense continues their Sunday productivity, Carson Wentz can remain mortal and playoff hopes can remain.  
9.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | 	-4	|	3-2	|	Avoid the deception of the final score, there was nothing close about this game. At one point in the third quarter, the score was 31-3, which would have a made a Cowboy victory one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history. But that simply wasn‚Äôt happening. The defense was gashed by the run, and the offense, despite moving the ball, fell prone to critical mistakes on key drives. Thankfully, Week 6 brings the Jets, and perhaps another temporary reprieve from reality.
10.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | 	+2	|	4-1	|	The Bills pulled it out again, and this time, it was in a game that could prove pivotal in the AFC Wildcard race. Questions remain about offensive production, but that can be at least partially attributed to the elite defenses they've played the last two weeks. Regardless, it's clear that Buffalo's defense is stellar enough to take them a long way. Going into the bye week at 4-1, the Bills will look to come out and keep it going against the winless Dolphins in Week 7.
11.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	-1	|	3-2	|	People say these division rivalry games are always close, but it was an unwelcome surprise to be one fumble away from probably losing to a 3rd-string QB. While the passing game has steadily deteriorated from Week 1, it still looks like the best air attack in the AFC North, and the Ravens are still the clear favorites to win the division.
12.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	-4	|	3-2	|	Chase Daniel did everyone in Chicago a solid by saving them from weeks of quarterback ""controversy"" as he threw away (three times!) a game the Raiders were very earnestly trying to lose. If last week was a demonstration of why the Bears don't need a good offense to win, this week showed why they at least need an average one. The Bears host Bye (0-0) next week with a serious need to find some answers on offense before they fall too far behind in a tough division.
13.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	+1	|	3-2	|	Through three blowout wins and two defensive, slugfest losses, the Vikings have the NFL's fourth-best point differential and somehow have yet to encounter a lead change.  Danielle Hunter notched his 45th career sack on Sunday, tying the record for sacks by a defender under 25.  The defense and offensive weapons look as good as ever, but the quarterback and pass protection still need to prove themselves against better competition.
14.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	+2	|	3-2	|	On Sunday, NRG was officially [Fuller's House](https://i.imgur.com/gOhILhL.jpg) as he put up an insane 14 catches on 16 targets for 217 yards and 3 TDs. Deshaun played so well his cleats are [headed to Canton](https://twitter.com/houstontexans/status/1181311455779577856?s=21). The O-line had a no-sack game for the first time in a long time, and everything seemed to be clicking. Now, is that because the Texans are good or because the Falcons are terrible? Time will tell. Regardless, spirits are high as the team heads into a tough matchup against the Chiefs where fans will see this year's edition of ""Who drafted a better QB in 2017?""
15.	| [](/IND) | Colts | 	+5	|	3-2	|	Talent and execution. It was in the blurb last week, and it's going in this week. The Colts thoroughly out-executed the Chiefs on Sunday, and it's not like the Chiefs are some poorly-coached clowns like the Browns. Frank Reich should be immensely proud of his work from Monday to Saturday on preparing his team to perform. **RUN THE DAMN BALL.**
16.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	-3	|	2-1-1	|	Tidbit: The Lions, Falcons, and 49ers are the only teams left who haven't played a division game. The Lions square off against the Packers and Vikings in the next two weeks and absolutely **must** come away with at least one win (preferably in Lambeau, where they have won 3 of the last 4 meetings) if they are going to keep their division hopes alive.
17.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers | 	+1	|	3-2	|	Against Minshew Mania, the Panthers relied on McCaffrey McCarrying the entire offense. In fact, it took some late-game cramps to give Reggie Bonnafon the chance to prove that other skill position players do exist on the roster. The coaching staff needs to stop placing so much overall pressure on a single player because the offense has looked more and more disjointed as defenses have adapted to Kyle Allen's film. The playcalling shackles him into a game manager role rather than letting him take risks and inevitably make mistakes. With a Tampa team looming that has proved capable of muzzling CMC, that means the rest of the offense needs to step up.
18.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	-3	|	2-3	|	The Chargers had absolutely no business making the game against the Broncos as close as it appeared on paper. Denver is not as bad as their record indicates, but the Chargers lost control from the outset, only regaining command too late to finish a comeback. The Chargers' first points came from a punt return touchdown late in the third quarter. The big takeaway from Coach Lynn's presser is that the Chargers won't beat anyone with that kind of play. Hard to disagree. Pittsburgh is next and presents a must-win situation if the Chargers want to keep pace with the AFC postseason contenders.
19.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	+4	|	3-2	|	Raiders fans had been dreading this game ever since the organization traded Khalil Mack, and the thought of Derek Carr getting sacked by his best friend was terrifying. All week Mack was talking about about being vindictive and subsequently scaring Raiders fans even more. Boy did he show how vindictive he was? 3 total tackles, no sacks, no tackles for loss, and 1 QB hit. Mack proved a point. Once a Raider, always a Raider. There was no way he could allow himself to put up big numbers against his true team. Fans can't wait to see Mack in the Silver and Black again in 2023.
20.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	-1	|	2-3	|	The Bucs lost a one score, yet one-sided, road game against the Saints, bringing Tampa's record to 2-3. Since 2016, GM Jason Licht has used seven draft picks in the first three rounds on DBs. That unit allowed 345 yards and 4 TDs against a backup QB on Sunday. The Bucs starting OL is paid a combined $39.1M this season; the same unit allowed Jameis to be sacked 6 times while also allowing 14 pressures and 8 hurries. Lights are symbols of hope, warmth, and life itself. Licht‚Äôs a symbol of the despair and alcoholism that‚Äôs crippled the Bucs fanbase since his arrival in 2014.
21.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	-4	|	2-3-0	|	Overhyped and overexposed, the Browns were dealt a very public [and humiliating](https://i.redd.it/z78nx745n7r31.gif) loss on national TV on Monday night.  Its hard to say what went well other than (checks notes), punting? The bye week can't come soon enough.
22.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	--	|	2-3	|	With 6:35 left in a game where the Titans had only put up 7 points so far, the offense found themselves at Buffalo's 35-yard line with a 4th-and-4. Vrabel still had more faith in his kicker, Cairo Santos, who had already missed three kicks earlier in the game, from 53 yards out than his offense's ability to gain 4 yards. It didn't work out. After the game, Vrabel showed even more confidence in in Santos by saying that he just needs to be coached up. Santos was cut on Monday.
23.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	-2	|	2-3	|	Five games into the season, and the Jaguars are playing exactly like everyone predicted: a flashy offense led by a 6th-round rookie and a defense that seems to be no more than a bump in the road at the best of times. Wait, *what*? The Jags D better figure out how to stop the run before the Saints pull a CMC: Part Deux and run all over them.
24.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	--	|	2-3	|	*Do you have QB problems? Can't seem to get your $30M a year passer and his receivers on the same page? Having trouble getting that passing offense ""up"" when it really matters? Then come on down to the Giants' Defense! You can find a solution for every problem at Big Blue Busted Coverage Crew, where the linebackers are all dead, the corners can't cover, and nobody knows how on God's green Earth a tackle is supposed to look! Located in the Heart of the Meadowlands, and if you subscribe today, we'll throw in offensive incompetence on the house!* 
25.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	--	|	1-4	|	The Steelers defense is on fire, but between penalties (earned and unearned), injuries, and poor decisions, it's just adding to the overall dumpster fire that is the 2019 season. Pittsburgh played tough against a superior Ravens team, but they can't rest on their laurels. There is no ""rebuilding year"" in the Steel City; only reloading. If they can overcome their misfortunes at the QB position and get some decent production out of it, perhaps the defense can carry the team to a wildcard spot in a wide-open AFC. 
26.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	+1	|	1-4	|	Despite giving up over a hundred penalty yards, fumbling three times, and throwing a pick, the Broncos somehow managed to get their first win of the season. Kareem Jackson and Alexander Johnson both had superb games, as did 2018 Pro Bowl entrant Phillip Lindsay. Could there be life in the 303? Stay tuned!
27.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	-1	|	1-4	|	To secure his job, Dan Quinn fired his defensive coordinator. Instead of hiring somebody else, he doubled down and took over defensive play-calling himself. On Sunday, the Falcons gave up 52 points. The last time a team put up more points against Atlanta wasn't the Bobby Petrino year. It wasn't the back end of Mike Smith's tenure; that man's weak heart put up a bigger fight than the Falcons did on Sunday. It was 2004. 15 years ago. The team went 11-5 and had Gregg Knapp on the payroll too, so maybe things are looking up for Atlanta. There isn't much room left to get worse.
28.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	--	|	1-3-1	|	A late defensive collapse almost spoiled the first win of the season for the Cardinals, but Murray looked great leading the team down the field and setting up a game-winning field goal as time expired. The offense moved the ball with relative ease, but they will need to fix their red zone issues to have a shot at beating Atlanta after settling for field goals at the 19, 4, 2, and 4-yard lines in the Cincinnati game.
29.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	--	|	0-5	|	It's unclear if AJ Green will come back this season. At 0-5, it's becoming increasingly clear that it won't matter.
30.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	--	|	0-4	|	[Yikes.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/351/177/6a5.jpg)
31.	| [](/WAS) | Redskins | 	--	|	0-5	|	Gruden is now gone. Washington showed appallingly little fight during the tail end of his coaching tenure, but it remains unclear what person fits the middle of the Venn diagram between 'someone who can fix Washington' and 'someone who is willing to take the Washington job.' Especially now that the team has been cursed in an ancient ceremony, the night is dark and there is no dawn in sight.
32.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	--	|	0-4	|	The race for the 1st pick is getting crowded as the Skins, Bengals, and Jets look completely lost as well. The scary part is that those teams aren't actually trying to lose. Meanwhile, the Steelers are circling as well as they lost another QB and are also on a downward trend.",1162,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/df4sw6/official_rnfl_week_5_power_rankings/,5893.664564915498,r/nfl
"After 5 weeks, the 49ers are the #1 team by FO's DVOA (stat-based) and the #1 team by PFF grade (film-based).

"NFL 2018 Standings, using Rugby Union Scoring","In honour of the ongoing Rugby World Cup, I was curious how the shape of the 2018 NFL season would change if they used their scoring system, instead of basing primarily on win/loss record.

The Rugby Union Scoring rules include ""Bonus Points"", and are described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_bonus_points_system), but, in summary:

* Win = 4 points
* Tie = 2 points
* Loss = 0 points
* Scoring 4+ TDs (""tries"" in rugby) in a game = 1 BP
* Losing by 7 or fewer points = 1 BP

Tiebreaker order in cases where teams are tied on total score:
* Total Point Difference
* Total TDs

For example: team A defeats team B 30-28, where team A scores 3 TDs and team B scores 4 TDs. Team A gets 4 points for winning, and team B gets 0 for losing, but gets 1BP from scoring 4 TDs, and 1BP for losing by fewer than 7 points, totalling 2 points.

The ""Actual Rank"" in the image was taken from nfl.com

**[Image of the standings here](https://imgur.com/4nhSPw7)** (Ordered by ""Total Score"" column)

Playoff Picture with these rankings (assuming NFL rules of the division leader + 2 best other teams in each conference)

AFC:

* #1: Chiefs
* #2: Patriots
* #3: Texans
* #4: *Steelers*
* #5: Chargers
* #6: Colts

These seedings are the same as the actual ones, with the exception of the Steelers replacing the Ravens, despite their slightly worse record.

NFC:

* #1: *Rams*
* #2: *Saints*
* #3: Bears
* #4: Cowboys
* #5: Seahawks
* #6: Eagles

The NFC is also similar to the actual playoffs, but the Rams take the #1 seed over the Saints (not going to add any further comments to this...). 


Interesting points of note:

**Biggest risers:**

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers** (8 positions)

The Bucs had 8 games where they scored 4+ TDs, fewer only than the Chiefs and Rams.

**New York Giants** (4 positions)

Although they lost 11 games, they lost 8 of these by 7 or fewer points. They were the ""best"" team at this, if one can be the best at losing.



**Biggest fallers:**

**Washington Redskins** (6 positions)

Despite going 7-9, the Redskins only had 1 game where they scored 4+ TDs (tied worse with the Broncos and Cardinals), and only 1 loss of 7 or fewer points.

**Buffalo Bills** and **Miami Dolphins** (5 positions)

Though they got more bonus points than the Redskins, the Bills and Dolphins couldn't keep pace with teams with similar records.


Teams that never lost by more than 7 points (i.e. they received at least 1 BP in each loss):

* Kansas City Chiefs
* Chicago Bears
* Houston Texans


TL;DR: Surprisingly there aren't many major changes in standings. In terms of the playoffs, only Steelers, Ravens, Rams and Saints fans need to be concerned.",7,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/df4et3/nfl_2018_standings_using_rugby_union_scoring/,5922.181231685479,r/nfl

An idea to fix Pass Interference reviews,"I think the majority of NFL fans can agree that the pass interference review process has been a mess. I'm personally in favor of just removing challenging pass interference completely, but I had an idea to possibly make it suck a little less.

The reviewer should be a league official that is not part of the current officiating crew and **not told told the call on the field, the time left in the game, the score, or which team has challenged.**

Presented with only the film of the play, they'll decide whether or not there was pass interference, and whether it was on the defense or the offense. This removes bias against overturning an official's call on the field and from previous calls in the game.

Looking at the play in a vacuum without outside factors and limiting bias as much as possible is the only way to salvage the challenge of pass interference, in my opinion.

Too hard on young QB's?,"Are we too hard on the young QB's? Mayfield, Rosen, Jackson, Jones, Haskins and the rest have  their struggles, but Peyton Manning threw 58 INT's his first 3 years. He developed, grew, matured and it worked out pretty darn good for him. I am a Browns fan and I also like Jones and Rosen. Not really worried about any of these guys at this point, unless they go all Manziel and refuse to try to get better at their craft.",35,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/df2424/too_hard_on_young_qbs/,6088.781232750416,r/nfl

Some quarter season predictions that are probably too soon,"I've been looking at the future schedule for various teams. When I do this, I like to mark each matchup as either an expected win, and expected loss, or a toss-up.

**The Bills**: Miami, Philly, Washington, Cleveland, Miami, Denver, Dallas, Balti, Pitt, NE, Jets.

The Bills should beat 'Phins, 'Skins, Broncos, and the Jets. 5 expected wins. Furthermore, I can say with some confidence they beat the Browns and Pittsburgh, but you never know. Eagles, 'Boys, and Ravens are a toss-up. After their game against the Pats, I'm also willing to give their last game against the Pats a tentative toss-up.

Conservatively, that leaves the Bills' expected floor at 9-7. I'd put an optimistic prediction at 11-5.

**The Raiders**: GB,  Hou, Detroit, LAC, Cinci, Jets, KC, Tenn, Jax, LAC, Denver

The Raiders should beat the Chargers, Bengals, Jets, and Broncos. 5 expected wins. However, I'd expect them to lose to the Packers and the Chiefs (no bias). Without toss-ups, that leaves them at 8-4. The question marks on their schedule are the Texans and Lions, who have proven themselves this season, and the bottom of the AFCS. both the Jags and the Titans have shown flashes of brilliance, so I'm not confident in writing them off.

Conservatively, the Raiders finish 8-8. Optimistically, they could finish anywhere from 9-7 to 12-4.

**The 49ers**: LAR, Washington, Carolina, Arizona, GB, Balti, NO, Atl, LAR, Seattle

That's an uncertain schedule right there. Rams have been all over the place this year. Consistently playing well, yet 3rd place in their division. Anyhow, the Niners should beat the 'Skins, Falcons, and Cards, for 4 expected wins. The rest of this schedule is too uncertain for me to feel comfortable making predictions, so I'll just take a crapshoot and say they end up 11-5.

**The Colts**: Hou, Denver, Pitt, Miami, Jax, Hou, Tenn, Tampa, NO, Carolina, Jax

The Colts should beat the 'Phins, Broncos, and Steelers. 3 Expected wins. Again, the Titans and Jags have all shown too much potential to be written off. However, this Colts team seems to have found it's stride, and I'd be willing to say they conservatively go 1-1 with the Jags, for 4 expected wins. Two games against a hot Texans team could be trouble. I would put the Saints down as an expected loss. The Bucs and the Panthers, who knows, but again, this team is striding.

Conservatively, let's say 8-8. Less conservatively, I'd say they go 2-0 against the Jags, 1-1 against the Texans, and beat the Bucs, Titans, and Panthers, putting them at around 12-4.

These are just the teams whose schedules interested me. I know that these conditions could change at a moment's notice, but I feel reasonably confident I'm close to the mark.",27,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/df1mfv/some_quarter_season_predictions_that_are_probably/,6123.114566250642,r/nfl

How this works:  
Each team started with a plot of land. If a team wins a game against a team that currently holds land, the winning team takes all of that land. This map is of where that land has ended up at this point in the season.  

Changes from last week:  
* The Colts coup against the Chiefs succeeds  
* The Saints conquer the Buccaneers, retaking their homeland  

Current Land Leaders (by starting plot count):  
10: Colts  
8: Saints  
4: Raiders, Eagles, Patriots  
2: 49ers  

Games with land at stake (teams with land **bolded**):  
Giants @ **Patriots**  
**Saints** @ Jaguars  
**Eagles** @ Vikings  
**49ers** @ Rams

What teams already had/currently have the greatest QB the franchise will ever have?,"It‚Äôs kind of crazy to think that at least a quarter of the league either already had or currently has the best quarterback the franchise is likely to ever see. 

* Patriots
* Packers
* Saints
* Colts
* Broncos
* 49ers
* Cowboys
* Steelers

I‚Äôm sure all of those teams will have great QBs in the future but it seems pretty unlikely they‚Äôll ever have one who has as much individual success as the best they‚Äôve already had.",100,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dezg61/what_teams_already_hadcurrently_have_the_greatest/,6292.281233700117,r/nfl
