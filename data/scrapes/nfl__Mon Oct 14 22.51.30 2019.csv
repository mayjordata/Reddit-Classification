"What's more impressive, a 4 TD game or a 4 goal game?: An analysis","Pasta's four goal game today [prompted this question on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BovadaOfficial/status/1183834253378969602). I've always liked how TDs scored and ice hockey goals come at similar rates on a per game basis, both for players and teams, and the answer to this wasn't 100% obvious to me, so I thought I'd do an analysis of which is rarer.

**Per Player or Per Game?**

To simplify things, I'm only going to look at how often this happens on a *per team game played* basis and not a *per player* basis.

Although NFL rosters are much larger, it's the six starters at offensive skill positions (including QB) on any given team that have a realistic chance at this. Remarkably, that's the same as the number of ""top six forwards"" per NHL team. So, while you could debate where exactly to draw the line in each, the number of players is about a wash anyway.

I'm also talking specifically about touchdowns **scored**, not four passing TD games, which aren't nearly as rare as either.

---

**NFL Frequency**

For each league, I'm going to look at the regular season for the five prior years as well as the ongoing one.

Since the start of 2014, there have been just *six* games in which a player scored four touchdowns, from the legendary Jonas Gray game against the Colts to Aaron Jones this year, so it happens about once per season: http://pfref.com/tiny/DGPR0

There are 256 NFL games per season, and there have been 91 so far this year, so it's happened six times in 1371 games / in 2742 team games played, or **Once every 457 games**.

---

**NHL Frequency**

There have been 21 such games in the NHL since the 2014-15 NHL season, including Pasta's today: http://hkref.com/tiny/OESkC

Before the Knights joined the NHL, there were 2460 team games per season. The last two years, Vegas brought that number up to 2542. Finally, there have been 166 so far this season ([154](http://hkref.com/tiny/rSWKq) + 6x2 today, including the one that's almost over but not the one that hasn't started yet), which brings us to 12,630 if I haven't fucked up my math.

That means a player has scored four goals **Once every 601 games**.

"What if, in 2003, you decided to bet the Patriots against the spread every week? A breakdown.","So I saw someone post that the Pats have been incredible ATS (against the spread) since 2003. Their record is 178-115 ATS since 2003. That's a 61% clip.

So I asked how much money would you have made if you put $50 down on them each game, then reevaluated your bankroll at the end of each season, and kept going.

Typical bankroll management says you should have around 20 bets in your bankroll. So if you're betting $50 a game, you should have $1000 in your bankroll.

So I went through each season since 2003 and did the numbers. (I rounded numbers off, no repeating decimals in these calculations LeRoy.)

The house takes about 10% of your bet, so that how you lose money in seasons they went .500 ATS. (I didn't include pushes into the calculation because they are worthless)

Analyzing the Dolphins' Two Point Conversion Attempt,"We all saw what happened on [the play.](https://twitter.com/NFL_DovKleiman/status/1183475701594370056) But after watching it a few times, I thought it seemed familiar. This is essentially the [same play](https://youtu.be/WwDpHHhDHWs?t=14) the Patriots used to tie the game at 28-28 in Super Bowl 51.  

It's basically a [tunnel screen](http://insidethepylon.com/football-101/glossary-football-101/2015/10/13/itp-glossary-tunnel-screen/) without the hitches, but there are some other slight differences. They both use 10 personnel and go trips left from the right hash, but the Patriots ran the play out of empty and the Dolphins ran it with a single back. The Patriots set up another screen to the right, but the Dolphins chose to send their single receiver to the right on what looks like a fade, but I'm not sure. It's hard to tell because he gets pressed immediately and the play is basically over. 

There are a few things that killed this play for the Dolphins:

* First and foremost, Kenyan Drake dropped the pass. You can't score if you don't catch the ball. One interesting note, though, is that Drake would've caught Fitzy's pass about two yards behind the LOS whereas Amendola caught Brady's pass right at the line, which is where the throw is usually supposed to go on a tunnel screen. Maybe this is exactly how the Dolphins drew it up, but I don't know. Either way, it wasn't executed properly.

* Secondly, the LT whiffed on his block. This play is designed to move quickly, so the edge rusher to the pass side will have enough time to turn back if the LT doesn't take him out. If the LT misses his block, you're turning a 3-on-3 into a 4-on-3 in the defense's favor. So it's a little unfair to compare this to the Amendola score, because Freeney was so far upfield that he basically took himself out of the play (probably because he was offsides). 

* Lastly, one of the blocking receivers didn't do his job. The lower receiver in the stack takes care of the slot defender, but the receiver on top attempts to block the outside CB who is trailing Drake instead of the CB who is pressing him. There is no tunnel through which Drake can travel. 

I don't think this was the worst play the Dolphins could've used here, but it was DOA because of the drop and all of the other things that went wrong. 

Thanks for reading!

tl;dr: The pass was dropped, the throw was too far back, the LT whiffed, and the blocking from the receivers wasn't good enough.

"Prior to yesterday, the Jets were on pace to be the worst passing team in the SB era compared to the league average","Before yesterday, the Jets were averaging 113.5 passing yds/g (net) which was only 46.9% of the 2019 league average (241.81 passing yds/g prior to yesterday). **That percentage was the worst deviation from the league average in any given year in the Super Bowl era.**

After yesterday, however, the Jets are now averaging 156 passing yds/g (net) which is 64.6% of the now 241.56 passing yds/g league average. I think it’s safe to say they won’t be the worst passing team moving forward if Darnold stays healthy.

The highest & lowest number of playoff opponents a team could theoretically face in the regular season,"I was bored recently and decided to figure out the lowest and highest number of opponents a team can face that could end up in the playoffs. 

To find the lowest number, I will use the Saints this season. the Saints schedule broken down like this

* 6 division games
* 4 NFC West games
* 4 AFC South games
* 1 Chicago Bears game
* 1 Dallas Cowboys game

The only guaranteed playoff spots are the NFC South, NFC West, & AFC South division winners. Here is the scenario that gives us the lowest number of playoff opponents possible

* Saints win division, No NFC South teams in the wildcard **(0)**
* The NFC West & AFC South division winners are the only teams from that division in the playoffs. **(2)**
* Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys miss the playoffs, with one wildcard from each of their divisions, or two from one of their divisions as long as they place fourth. **(0)**

In this scenario, the saints will have only played against **2** opponents who made the playoffs.

Now for the highest, I will use the falcons because they won't make the playoffs in this scenario and that makes me happy. Falcons schedule is broken down like this

* 6 division games
* 4 NFC West games
* 4 AFC South games
* 1 Philadelphia Eagles game
* 1 Minnesota Vikings game

They already face the guaranteed 2, and if they lose the division, it gets bumped to 4, because they play 2 against the division winner. But many more ridiculous things are able to take place in order to bump the number higher. this is the scenario with the highest number of playoff opponents possible

* Saints, Bucs, & Panthers make the playoffs. **(6)**
* Any NFC West team wins the division. **(1)**  
* Eagles and Bears both win their divisions. **(2)**
* 3 of the 4 AFC South teams make the playoffs. **(3)**

The Falcons will have played **12** of their 16 games against opponents who made the playoffs. There are 12 teams that make the playoffs every year and the Falcons will have played against 9 of them, 3 of which they played twice. 

This is not very far outside the realm of possibility. 3 teams from one division have made the playoffs a few times, most recently in 2017, and as far back as 1990, when playoffs first became a 6-team tournament. Since the division realignment in 2002, it has happened 7 times. In 2007, both the AFC South and NFC East did it, but they did not play against each other, So facing 12 playoff opponents didn't happen. 

3 teams from one division have made the playoffs 7/32 times or 21.875% of the time. Two cross-conference divisions play each other every 4 years or 25% of the time. The odds that these line up are 5.46%. However, since the two additional conference opponents must also win their division (25% odds each), The odds drop to .34% chance of this happening.

**TLDR:** A team could play as few as 2, or as many as 12 playoff opponents in the regular season.",11,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhuzj0/the_highest_lowest_number_of_playoff_opponents_a/,667.2961414297422,r/nfl

"Last year, KC had the 7th worst T.O.P and had the #1 offense in the league.","I think arguing that beating the Chiefs using the ground and pound is effective but I think it's been more about the offense than the defense. The Chiefs don't need much time to score.

I think these are the two issues.
Offensive line isn't nearly as good as last year. Missing THEE #1 Pick Eric Fisher has created alot of issues. Erving is a horrible run blocker and below average pass blocker.

Chiefs play soft coverage.
Last year while they couldn't stop much of anything, at least created some turnovers and 3 & Outs. This year for some strange reason are ok letting the team go 10-12 plays eat clock and play everything underneath. If you had the offense KC has, you're defense should be extremely aggressive and if you get burned, so be it. Sutton wasn't great but at least we played man to man and press a fair amount.",16,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhufuk/last_year_kc_had_the_7th_worst_top_and_had_the_1/,705.7461418151855,r/nfl

Vita Vea is the best run stopper in the NFL,"Vita Vea is the reason why Bucs are so freaking good against the run this year. His stats don’t show it but he’s an animal on the inside against the run. He gets insane push in the middle that completely stops the run before it can reach the LOS while his team cleans up. 

Game 1: This season Matt Breida has 376 yards, averaging 5.8 YPC. He was held to 15 carries for 37 yards. 

Game 2: CMC has 618 yards, 4.9 YPC; he was held to 16 carries for 37 yards.

Game 3: Barkley got hurt early in the 2nd quarter but he was held to 8 carries for 10 yards before the injury.  In the games he played he has 237 yards, 6.4 YPC.

Game 4: Gurley has 270 yards, 4.2 YPC. He was held to 5 carries for 16 yards. Malcolm Brown has 154 yards this season averaging 4.2 YPC. He was held to 5 carries for 14 yards. 

Game 5: Kamara has 373 yards this season with 4.3 YPC. He was held to 16 carries for 62 yards.

Game 6: CMC was held to 22 carries for 31 yards.

Does Marty Hurney have the best record of 1st round draft picks of any general manager in NFL history?,"This thread is inspired by Brian Burns looking like a future hall of famer, selected all the way at 16.

Literally every 1st round pick he has ever made has been an excellent player, at the top and bottom of the 1st round.  His worst 1st round pick might be Jonathan Stewart, who was still an top tier running back.  The guy drafts nothing but all pros and hall of famers.

If you're young, or not from the Carolinas, you might not know how good Jon Beason, Chris Gamble, or Jordan Gross were.  Cam Newton (gutsy selection at the time) would have been an alltime great quarterback if they (see, Dave Gettleman) had put a competent offensive line around him at some point and not allowed him to suffer 6 concussions per game.  His MVP year showed what he was capable of, was just unfortunate to have a similar arc to Andrew Luck.

Why did we think Zac Taylor was an offensive genius?,"Let's take a deep look at Zac Taylor's coaching timeline:

* After flaming out of the NFL and CFL, Taylor was looking for work
* He **began his coaching career under his father-in-law Mike Sherman** at Texas A&M in 2008
   * In his time from 2008-2011, Sherman served as a a Graduate Assistant and Tight Ends coach
* Mike Sherman was fired from Texas A&M in 2011 but was hired as the Offensive Coordinator for the Miami Dolphins for the 2012 season
   * It seems a bit weird that Mike Sherman was hired as an OC when he was fired from a college team after a super disappointing 4 years at A&M. Let's see how that happened:
      * Philbin is named head coach
      * Philbin hired Sherman to be his OC
      * Previously, Sherman gave Philbin his first job in the NFL when Sherman was the Head Coach/GM of the Packers - So it seems that Philbin was returning the favor
      * Sherman was happy to have his son-in-law tag along
      * *Yes, Nepotism is a common theme here*
* Obviously, Taylor was now in need of work so again he followed his father-in-law and join the Miami Dolphins as an Assistant QB Coach
   * Taylor was promoted to QB Coach in 2013
* Mike Sherman left the Dolphins to coach high school football in 2014 and Bill Lazor was hired
* In 2015, Bill Lazor is fired and our boy Zac Taylor is named Interim Offensive Coordinator
   * **As OC, points decrease 17%, yards decrease 8%, and touchdowns decrease 24%**
   * Yes, this is the same Bill Lazor that Zac Taylor replaced in Cincinnati (Lazor was the playcaller when he was fired)
   * **Taylor's success in Miami was ""developing Ryan Tannehill""** (developing him to what?)
* Dolphins decided to part ways with Taylor and Taylor was hired as OC for Cincinnati after Jim Turner put in a good word to Tommy Tuberville (Cincinnati's head coach)
   * **In his 1 season at Cincinnati, Taylor's offense failed to score a TD in 3 games**
   * **His team went 4-8**
* Taylor was hired as assistant QB coach in 2017 and promoted to QB coach in 2018
   * Taylor studied under McVay but never was the playcaller
* In 2019 he was named Head Coach of the Bengals
   * **Bengals are 0-6**
   * **Rank 29th in points per game**
   * **Rank 32nd in rushing yards per game**

There's a long history of a lack of success in Taylor's coaching past. Let's see some excuses we can make for Taylor to make us feel better:

* He inherited Marvin Lewis's team
* He doesn't have AJ Green
* His offensive line sucks",50,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhqx18/why_did_we_think_zac_taylor_was_an_offensive/,954.2128094514211,r/nfl

At what point do people start holding Telesco in the same light as Grigson?,"Name one fucking year where the Chargers have had a good offensive line in the last five years. Here’s a hint: YOU FUCKING CAN’T!

Every **fucking** year it’s the same damn thing. The fanbase (what’s left of it) begs for a Oline focused draft. What we get instead is more fucking SKILL position players. For fucks sake Telesco you fucking **DONKEY** we already have a top 5 wr core stop spending cap and picks on people like TRAVIS BENJAMIN OH MY FUCKING GOD!

We are literally the reincarnation of the 2014 colts and 2014 cowboys except even LESS people like us, and we won’t learn our lesson eventually because this is “the Charger way”. The GM keeps getting called *”CoUpOn GoD TeLeScO”* by the fanbase while getting paid millions to pretend everything is going well because our offense is putting up 2000 yards a game because Rivers has just enough time to fucking throw a prayer before he gets demolished which results in a 30 yard gain or an interception.

This is NOT fucking ok. We have WASTED the career of a QB who would otherwise have been a HOF on any other team. Guess whose  thrown the most yards without a super bowl appearance? GUESS whose had the most starts without a super bowl appearance?! 

Alright I think that’s enough. I’ll see you all next year after we go 6-10 and draft some hot shot WR for our first pick next year.

"The 49ers are now 5-0 for the first time since October 14, 1990.","Sunday's 20-7 win over the LA Rams put the 49ers at 5-0, nearly 29 years to the last 5-0 start. On October 14, 1990, behind six touchdown passes by Joe Montana, the 49ers defeated the Atlanta Falcons [45-35](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199010140atl.htm) in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.

The [1990 49ers](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1990.htm) finished the 1990 season 14-2 and appeared in the NFC Championship, losing to future Super Bowl champion New York Giants. The head coach that year was George Seifert, and his staff included an offensive coordinator named Jon Gruden.

Of course, the name ""San Francisco 49ers"" was far more accurate back then, because the home stadium was the now demolished Candlestick Park in San Francisco. In 1990, the Rams football team was also based in Los Angeles, five years before the move to St. Louis (and 25 before the return to LA). Although the Rams finished [5-11 in 1990](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/1990.htm), by week 12 they got to be the [first team to give the 49ers an L](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199011250sfo.htm).

"Why did the nfl get rid of ""under the hood"" referee reviews?","I just noticed that this season when referees are going to watch the film for a challenge or to review a disputed call, they're just looking into a tablet held by some random guy in an nfl jacket. I remember they used to have a whole booth setup where the ref went ""under the hood"" to watch the play at their discretion. 

This seems like a big step down in the quality of replay reviews, right when the reviews themselves are becoming more common. Is this simply because the nfl partnered with Microsoft to promote their tablets? why does the nfl not use the ""under the hood"" replay booths they used to?

Edit: thanks all for replies, it seems my question has been answered. I didn’t realize the ref on the field had very little to do with the call. It’s more just for him to look than to actually analyze the play. 

That being said, those of you who claimed Microsoft money aren’t necessarily wrong. They switched from the “under the hood” booth to just a tablet the same year they partnered with Microsoft.

Why kick the XP when you're down 2?,"A moment ago, towards the end of the 2nd quarter, the Texans scored a TD against the Chiefs to bring the score to 17-15.    They elected to kick the XP and bring the score to 17-16, rather than go for 2 and tie the game.  The commentators seemed to agree that this was standard procedure, ""Don't want to get over-aggressive this early in the game.""

I have watched football my entire life and I still do not understand this concept.  I am Mugatu at the end of Zoolander... ""I FEEL LIKE I AM TAKING CRAZY PILLS!""  

When you go for 2... Best-case scenario: You score 2 and tie the game.  If the game stays as is, you go to OT.  You can run your normal offense for the duration of the game, save your TOs, etc.  Worst-case scenario:  You're down 2 and know you need at least a FG to win the game.  

Kicking the XP and staying down 1, both your best-case and worst-case scenario are the same: You're down 1 to 2 and know you need at least a FG to win the game.  There is little-no-difference between being down 1 or 2 points.

This is not a new debate but maybe I need to be refreshed as we are only in Week 6 of the new season: WHY THE F@#$ WOULD YOU NOT ATTEMPT TO TIE THE GAME?",22,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhehj6/why_kick_the_xp_when_youre_down_2/,2116.229480532805,r/nfl

The case for Paris as a future NFL international destination,"* Second largest metropolitan area in the European Union, after London (and will be the largest if Brexit ever happens)
* 2 1/2 hour train ride from London on the Eurostar, so a game in Paris could still have a British audience while attracting a greater continental audience
* Has an 80,000 seat stadium where the national soccer team plays (Stade de France in Saint-Denis)
* Paris will host the 2024 Olympics; France has hosted the 1998 World Cup will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup (both of which had/will have the final in Paris), so Paris is clearly suitable to host big sporting events
* France has a big rugby following like the UK. American football could be easily digestible to a French audience since much of the gameplay is similar to rugby.
* There will be an NBA regular season game in Paris this season between the Hornets and Bucks.

Possible solution to the challenged call problem?,I’ve pitched this to several people and received  good feedback so I thought I’d ask reddit. What about sending challenged calls to a third party ref crew that doesn’t know the score of the game or the call on the field? You just show them the play and ask what the call should be. I’ve seen way too many calls not overturned this year (most recently Pats v Giants) and believe this would solve the problem. Might speed up the process as well. Thoughts?,33,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhatpy/possible_solution_to_the_challenged_call_problem/,2400.4961482485137,r/nfl

Best likely free agents for 2020.,"Who in your opinion are the best Free Agents unlikely to re-sign with their current teams going into 2020. 

My list is currently

 Trae Waynes DB MN- he is likely far out of the Minnesota price range seeing as they have negative cap space for next year as is.

Kenyan Drake RB Miami- guy is so under utilized by Miami who cannot build a lead. 4.9 ypc vs the good Chargers defence but he essentially acts as a pass blocker for 3/4s of every game. 

Anthony Costanzo OT Ind- good tackles are hard to find and this guy has been solid for years.

Vonn Bell Safety NO- a solid safety that I highly doubt the Saints can afford with their tight salary cap and the questions of QB with Brees approaching retirement and Bridgewater performing well.",101,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dh2zen/best_likely_free_agents_for_2020/,3237.6961487015087,r/nfl

Does Russell Wilson have insane pocket awareness?,"Staying in Seattle for a bit, I got the chance to watch some Seahawks games lately. One thing I’ve noticed was Russell Wilson’s ability to maneuver in the pocket when the opposing offense is trying to get a sack.

There was so many moments where I’ve seen where he moves so smoothly in the pocket to get the right pass out in the face of pass rushers. 

There was even a few times in the game against the saints a few weeks ago where a linebacker was trying to tackle Wilson from behind while Wilson was making a pass and he just quickly ducked to avoid the contact and completed the pass to Dissly. He didn’t even look back to see if there was someone coming from behind. It was literally magic.

They agreed it was not a foul (would have been an ejection for a period of time) because the runner significantly lowered his body into contact and the defender looked like they were trying to make a solid tackle to the chest area.

"[OC] Total QB damage, the three legged stool, and the new Deshaun Watson","Recently, the Gods of Football Reference blessed us with [advanced offensive](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing_advanced.htm) & [defensive](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/defense_advanced.htm) stats for their player and team pages. This advanced data only starts since last year.

One of the things they've added is quarterback hits (the times a QB hits the ground when there is not a sack). This definition got me thinking about how we think about what I'll call QB damage, or the times a QB gets hit by a defender beyond just getting their jersey pulled a bit. Just using sacks alone gives us really only half the picture as we've seen QBs get [injured from a hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSe-mQWyafQ) despite no sack being recorded.

So I added sacks and hits since 2018 together (updated through week 5) to create what I'll call the Total QB Damage metric.

https://i.imgur.com/MBisvN9.png

As you can see, Deshaun Watson still reigns as the NFL's crash test dummy by about 30 more blows than the next guy. That probably doesn't shock anyone. However Mahomes and Ryan don't seem like two guys who get a lot of talk about how much they get hit, but Mahomes has been hit more than any QB in the past two seasons. We are talking about it now because he's finally gotten hurt, but last year I'm not sure anyone noticed that.

But looking down the list, it immediately got me thinking about what some people call the three legged stool QB.

Football Outsiders [just had a tidbit](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/quick-reads/2019/week-2-quick-reads) about this the other day, trying to quantitatively bucket players into three categories when under pressure:

Bystander - a QB who will wait for coverage to open up instead of throwing it away or throwing into tight coverage, so he probably will be sacked more

Gunslinger - a QB who throws into a tight window thus risking an interception rather than throw it away or wait for a WR to get open, so he will probably be hit more

Game Manager - a QB who will just throw it away under pressure rather than forcing a throw or waiting, so he will probably be sacked/hit the least

Just 2018

https://i.imgur.com/fkp8Xhv.png

Most of these things make sense (Brett Favre in the gunslinger, Deshaun Watson in the bystander, Alex Smith in the game manager).

And when you look at the Total QB Damage list, that matches up a bit. 

Deshaun Watson has been sacked a lot, but is middle of the pack in hits (remember this excludes sacks), like a bystander might be.

Mahomes ranks the highest in hits but amongst the bottom in sacks, like a gunslinger might be.

Joe Flacco and Drew Brees are in the bottom of both, like a game manager might be.

Now going back to Deshaun ""crash test dummy"" Watson, here is Watson’s average time to throw and rank by year

2019: 2.82 seconds (7th)

2018: 3.01 seconds (4th)

2017: 3.1 seconds (1st)

From 2017 to 2019 Watson has held the ball for about as long as anyone in the league, but here is the thing... [he might be moving](https://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-Deshaun-Watson-sacked-6-times-in-loss-14477541.php) from the bystander category to the gunslinger category (both have their pros and cons and neither is explicitly better than the other).

>""I held the football too long and I fumbled the ball and things like that,"" Watson said. ""The O-line did a hell of a job. That's me. I've got to check the ball down, take what they give us.

That was after the week 4 Panthers loss where he was sacked six times. So in came the Falcons in week 5 and did Watson respond?


2017: 3.1 seconds (1st)

2018: 3.01 seconds (4th)

2019 week 1: 2.73

2019 week 2: 3.01

2019 week 3: 3.02

2019 week 4: 2.91

**2019 week 5: 2.43**

That's the quickest he's gotten rid of the ball in a game in his career (he was regularly posting 3.4+ second hold times at one point including a crazy **3.6 second** average hold time in week 5 of 2017).

In 2017 when Watson got the ball out in under 2.5 seconds, he had a league best 120 passer rating. When Watson took more than 2.5 seconds, it dropped to 91.6.

It remains to be seen obviously if this was a one game blip or Watson is really going to continue to get rid of the ball quicker, but since there is growing consensus that [sacks are](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-z-quarterbacks-in-control-a-pff-data-study-of-who-controls-pressure-rates) mostly [due to](https://theathletic.com/1161053/2019/08/29/russell-wilsons-final-obstacle-and-how-he-seems-to-be-overcoming-it/) the [quarterback](https://www.thebiglead.com/2018/10/19/sacks-are-a-quarterback-stat/), we could see Watson's sack rate plummet, and thus, move down the Total QB Damage list.",23,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dgko2o/oc_total_qb_damage_the_three_legged_stool_and_the/,4893.512816532453,r/nfl
