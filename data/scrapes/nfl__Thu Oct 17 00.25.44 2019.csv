What would it take to get Hunter Henry,"The chargers have had a disappointing start after a great year last year. With Henry’s injury history and being in the last year of his contract is it possible they would move him?

I can’t imagine wanting to sign him to anything long so it feels likely he hits free agency and I doubt he is worth much in terms of compensation picks. 

If the Chargers lose to either the Titans or Bears I think he would make sense to move if the Chargers can get a 4th rounder. If the Chargers win both those games I think they keep him and maybe look to buy rather than sell. 

What do you think Hunter Henry has for value?",21,0.17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dj290x/what_would_it_take_to_get_hunter_henry/,72.11041581630707,r/nfl

Where is Josh Rosen going next?,"Josh Rosen is a great talent who has been abused by two NFL teams. Cards shit around him in an Offensive system that didn't work out. Rather than go after someone who can develop him they went after a college coach who got fired to bring his air raid to the NFL and then shipped Rosen off. 

Of all places fucking Miami. I'm sure Rosen is lovin the nightlife but let's be honest Miami was all about tua for the longest time. I don't think Rosen was ever going to stand a chance in Miami.  So. Miami will likely draft Tua or Joe Burrow or Justin Herbert and move on from Rosen

Where does he land next. Does Bruce Arians give a look at him in Tampa? Does Denver give him a look? Yeah I know they got Drew Locke but Rosen is tall which Elway likes. Do the raiders? Do the Pats?

In regards to improvement who has the better chance of getting better Over there first few seasons : a rookie cornerback being on the same team as a star reciever. Or a rookie wide receiver being on the same team as a star cornerback?,"These past two years has been the most I have watched football and so far I have become more and more curious about the game itself.  One thing I have been curious about is the development of a young Reciever and a rookie defensive back. 

I know college performance is way different than the nfl. But in general how well do rookie wrs/cbs do when they actually get to practice against top players?

Dede Westbrook is a receiver that comes to mind. Like he did okay last season. I was expecting him to do good since he was able to practice against Jalen Ramsey and Aj Bouye on a weekly basis.   

I’m also curious about how good are top reciever prospects going into the draft?  Like DJ chark’s performance got me wondering about how good these fresh rookie WRs are.  Like could these guys really just easily get past veteran defensive backs? Also Aj brown, and dk metcalf. 

I remember Jalen Ramsey was a stellar athlete in college.Guy got drafted in 2016 and his last two seasons took him to the pro bowl twice.

PFF League Offense rankings,"The Top 10 Offenses:

10 - 49ers
> As one of the league’s most beautiful coaching minds, Kyle Shanahan is making us all believers in San Francisco. Shanahan has an unprecedented offense in regard to his pre-snap movements and personnel package he trots out there. Compared to the league average, Shanahan’s usage of two running back packages is astronomically high and so is their efficiency with the second-highest EPA per play on those plays. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo passing out of these sets has been highly effective, as well. He has recorded an 11.8 yards per attempt average, a 136.4 passer rating and 82.9% adjusted completion percentage with a 10.0 ADOT on such throws.

9 - Raiders
> Gruden’s squad of grinders in Oakland find themselves ninth in EPA per play through Week 6. Rookie Josh Jacobs has been dangerous after contact with 0.26 broken tackles per attempt and 3.6 yards after contact per attempt (both rank in top 10). While a first-round investment in a running back isn’t the best decision, Jacobs is one of PFF’s highest-graded rookies and solidified his future as Oakland’s premiere back. In regard to PFF passing grade, quarterback Derek Carr ranks sixth at 79.4. Gruden’s west coast offense has resulted in Carr having the second-lowest average depth of target at 6.0. However, that doesn’t mean he can’t throw it downfield. Carr’s 92.7 passing grade on throws 10-plus yards ranks third only behind Aaron Rodgers and Carson Wentz.


8 - Cardinals
> With the selection of one player in the 2019 draft, the Cardinals went from 32nd to eighth in EPA per play. First overall pick Kyler Murray has stood out through the air and on the ground, and his multi-facet play is precisely the reason why the Cardinals own the eighth-best offense. Murray has improved his passing performance week-by-week, and his last two have been his best. Over the last two weeks, Murray ranks fifth in PFF passing grade at 83.2 and has produced six big-time throws and zero turnover-worthy plays. When taking off and running, Murray has picked up nine runs of 10 or more yards and recorded an 83.5 rushing grade on the year (second-best for a quarterback).

7 - Vikings
> After putting up two absurd performances from a passing perspective in Weeks 5 and 6, quarterback Kirk Cousins overcame the drama in Minnesota to put the Vikings’ seventh in our rankings. Over the last two weeks, Minnesota has ranked first in EPA per pass at 0.607 while Cousins had seven big-time throws and zero turnover-worthy plays. Cousins and the Vikings passing attack has produced the best results when running play-action, ranking sixth in EPA per play and third in passing grade at 90.6.

6 - Colts
> Despite not having Andrew Luck as their signal-caller, head coach Frank Reich has brought his team of misfits together to comprise one of the NFL’s most efficient offenses. Running behind the NFL’s second-best run-blocking unit in regard to PFF grade, the Colts rank third in EPA per rush attempt. The heir to Luck, Jacoby Brissett, has produced very few big-time throws, but this is due to having a conservative passing offense with a 7.2 average depth of target. Brissett and the Colts have been effective on these short throws, though, ranking third in accuracy percentage and fourth in passer rating generated at 105.8

5 - Falcons
> It’s time to hit the panic button on the Atlanta Falcons after their 1-5 start to the year. These struggles, however, aren’t coming from the offense. Led by Matt Ryan, the Falcons’ pass offense ranks fifth in expected points added per pass. Ryan has limited throwing uncatchable passes downfield to comprise the fourth-best adjusted completion percentage on throws 10-plus yards at 64.4%. Ryan’s eight turnover-worthy plays on these throws, though, are the most in the NFL. Nonetheless, if he can avoid those costly turnovers downfield, this offense can creep towards number one.


4 - Texans
> Second-year quarterback Deshaun Watson has been the heart and soul of this Texans offense. Watson has been a big playmaking threat both passing and running with the second-highest big-time throw rate at 7.5% and ranking fifth in EPA per play on his rushes. The running backs in Houston have done their part, as well. Houston has two running backs in the top 15 in PFF rushing grade (Carols Hyde at 15th and Duke Johnson Jr. 11th). On running back carries, the Texans have the second-highest EPA per play.

3 - Ravens
> Led by dual threat quarterback Lamar Jackson, the Ravens’ rushing attack has put together 33 runs of 10 or more yards and have combined for 46 broken tackles. Thus, it should be no surprise the Ravens are far and away the most efficient rushing attack in regard to EPA per rush. Jackson’s accuracy has come back down to earth after his superb two weeks to open up the season; however, he still has brought the Ravens’ passing offense up from 19th in 2018 to seventh in 2019.

2 - Cowboys
> It’s amazing what a good play-caller can do for an offense as a whole, and the Dallas Cowboys are prime example of that. After ranking 22nd in passing offense under former offensive coordinator Scott Linehan in 2018, the Cowboys jump up to second in that same category under analytics supporter Kellen Moore. Not to mention, the Cowboys are also one of five offenses to generate positive EPA per play on rushing attempts thus far in 2019. Whether it’s Prescott dropping back to pass or Tony Pollard receiving the handoff, the Cowboys’ offense has shown to be one of the most improved and one of the best of 2019.

1 - Chiefs
> To no surprise, the Andy Reid system in Kansas City is the top offense in the NFL and undoubtedly the best passing attack. Patrick Mahomes may not be at the top of his game to start the season with five turnover-worthy plays and a 76.1 passing grade, but his ability to create outside of structure is unmatched. On plays where Mahomes’ first read isn’t there and he is forced to his next, the Chiefs rank first in EPA per pass.

I have compiled some research and here's what I have about the host cities history of the Super Bowl since the year 2000.,"\- The NFC has been picked to host a Superbowl 14 times. The AFC with 7.

  


\- Host cities have had its tenants make the postseason 4 times (Tampa Bay in 2000, Arizona in 2014, Houston in 2016 and Minnesota in 2017) with 7 teams having .500 or better records:

 *  Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-6 in 2000, 9-7 in 2008)
 *  San Diego Chargers (8-8 in 2002)
 *  Jacksonville Jaguars (9-7 in 2004)
 *  Arizona Cardinals (8-8 in 2007, 11-5 in 2014)
 *  New York Jets (8-8 in 2013)
 *  Houston Texans (9-7 in 2016)
 *  Minnesota Vikings (13-3 in 2017)

  


\- The Minnesota Vikings remain the only team to make further from having its team play in their own building in the SB playing in the NFC championship game in 2017 losing to the eventual SB champions Philadelphia Eagles.

  


\- The New England Patriots have played in the big game 9 times outta the 20 times it has been a AFC representative in the super bowl going 6-3. 2 of those losses came against Eli Manning and the New York Giants (XLII and XLVI) the 3rd and most recent going to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. Their 1-3 record against a NFC East opponent is the worst by a AFC opponent that has made it more than twice in that span.

  


\- The Seattle Seahawks are the only team to have won an Super Bowl in a host city that have both a NFC and AFC tenant (Super Bowl XLVIII in MetLife Stadium)

  


\- Baltimore, Pittsburgh and The NY Giants have 2 SB titles each with Philadelphia, New Orleans, Seattle, Indianapolis, Denver, St. Louis/LA Rams, Green Bay and Tampa Bay each having won only one.

  


\- There has been 8 times an AFC representative won in a NFC host city SB, 6 times an NFC representative won in a NFC host city with 4 times an AFC representative winning it in a AFC host city and 3 times an NFC representative winning in a AFC host city.",4,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/diwy49/i_have_compiled_some_research_and_heres_what_i/,539.4104166189829,r/nfl

Fun Fact: the 1993 NFL season was the only one in league history to have an 18 week regular season and two bye weeks for each team,"I was surprised to find out this idea that everybody has been proposing regarding the CBA talks has actually been done before.

Per the Wikipedia page:

>After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in 1990, the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue. This was also done to avoid scheduling playoff games on January 1 and competing with college football bowl games. However, teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines, and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended.",24,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/disdhi/fun_fact_the_1993_nfl_season_was_the_only_one_in/,854.8937508662542,r/nfl

On this day in 2006: the Chicago Bears score 3 TDs to come back from a 23-3 deficit vs the Cardinals in MNF. None of the TDs were on offense.,"It sounds impossible, but it was just the 2006 Bears.

With under a minute left in the 3rd quarter, the Chicago Bears trailed the Arizona Cardinals 23-3 on MNF and the Cardinals had the ball. Cardinals QB Matt Leinart got strip sacked by Mark Anderson on 2nd down, and the ball was promptly scooped and scored by Mike Brown to make it 23-10.

The Bears offense did not score in its next *3 possessions* but with about 5 minutes left in the game, Cardinals RB Edgerrin James gets the ball knocked loose by Brian Urlacher; the ball was picked up by Charles Tillman of the Bears and taken all the way. The score was now 23-17.

The Bears' defense wasn't done. In the next Cardinals' possession, they forced a punt in short order. Cardinals' punter Scott Player makes the curious decision to boot it to Devin Hester. As any reasonable person could expect, Hester made em pay, with an 83 yard house call on the punt return to take the lead 24-23. That's the score the game would end on.

As far as I know, there has never been another instance of a team coming back from a 3 score deficit scoring 0 points on offense. If I'm wrong I'd love to know about it.

NFL Week 7 Predictions Thread (2019 Season),"Hello and welcome,  /r/NFL, to another week of predictions! We still have two undefeated teams remaining, with six divisional matchups on the list as well as four more teams on byes. Last week, I was able to improve to 10-4, bringing me to 58-34. Please share how you're doing so far. Let's get to it!

---

Winner||Loser|Comments
-|-|-|-
[](/KC) Chiefs | over | [](/DEN) Broncos | Yes, the Chiefs have lost two in a row. I would imaging that they're pretty fired up to be facing a Denver team that has now won two in a row, coming off a shutout win against the Titans. This divisional game could be a lot closer than we think.
[](/LAR) Rams | over | [](/ATL) Falcons | It's going to be hard picking the Falcons to win any remaining games unless some major changes start happening. The Rams are still in the thick of things, and bringing in Ramsey will help that secondary a lot. I'm excited to see how he and Julio match up.
[](/BUF) Bills | over | [](/MIA) Dolphins | The same goes for Miami. The Bills have been quietly nipping at the Patriots' heels for the division lead and I think they keep at it this week.
[](/JAX) Jaguars | over | [](/CIN) Bengals | Battle of the big cats. The Jags won't lose a step with Ramsey gone, because he hasn't played at all this month. Minshew and Chark, with a dash of Fournette, will get this team back to winning this week.
[](/MIN) Vikings | over | [](/DET) Lions | I kind of want to give Detroit a sympathy pick for that bullshit call on MNF, but things will not get any easier for them this week. Minnesota looks like they got their act together and are starting to gel together as a team.
[](/GB) Packers | over | [](/OAK) Raiders | Even with the bad call, the Packers were able to overcome their deficit and win that game. They face a mildly fresh Oakland team looking to grab the opportunity of giving the Chiefs some competition in the division. Should be a good game.
[](/HOU) Texans | over | [](/IND) Colts | Surprisingly, this will be a great divisional game. Early on, this could have playoff implications. Brissett has done amazingly well and Watson is showing his MVP eligibility every week. I'm hoping for a shootout.
[](/NYG) Giants | over | [](/ARI) Cardinals | Rookie QB battle! This should be an entertaining matchup. I think homefield will give the Giants a slight edge. That, and I think Barkley is possibly going to see the field this week.
[](/SF) 49ers | over | [](/WAS) Redskins | Surprisingly, I think the Redksins will bring it this week. They have a chance to prove all the doubters wrong by upsetting an undefeated team. I can see that happening, but I'm still playing it safe and picking a dominant San Fran team.
[](/LAC) Chargers | over | [](/TEN) Titans | Damn, Titans fell hard over the past few weeks. It's going to be rough winning games when you get shut out by the one-win Broncos, and end up benching Mariota for Tannehill, who even the Dolphins didn't want. Chargers by at least a TD.
[](/CHI) Bears | over | [](/NO) Saints | I hate picking against my Saints, even though I think they could definitely win this one. With Kamara nursing an ankle injury and Teddy up and down between game manager and best backup ever, that Chicago defense will be tough to overcome. But the Saints defense will keep the Bears in check, so this will be a very low scoring game.
[](/SEA) Seahawks | over | [](/BAL) Ravens | Bird fight! Homefield for Seattle is hard to pick against. And Wilson is playing at a high level now. But the Ravens are no slouches either, so I think this could be a shootout with a team winning by a field goal.
[](/DAL) Cowboys | over | [](/PHI) Eagles | I think they're due a win. I believe Zeke will put on a good show and Cooper will have an OK performance, but Dallas will pull off a close win against a Philly team that I have no clue as to how they will perform. This is for the NFC East lead, so it should be close.
[](/NE) Patriots | over | [](/NYJ) Jets | Darnold came back with mono superpowers or something. Is having their starting QB back all the Jets needed to start winning games? It's one hell of a test this week, going up against the Dark Lord. I hope it's not a blowout and the Jets have some surprises for us.

**Byes:** [](/CLE) Browns, [](/PIT) Steelers, [](/TB) Buccaneers Colts, [](/CAR) Panthers

NFL Rules Question: Allowing Your Opponent to Score,"In the Monday night game, Packers vs Lions, towards the end of the game (under 2 minutes) with Packers down 2 points and driving for the go ahead score. The Packers RB chose to purposely give himself up at the 2 yard line, instead of scoring the easy TD. The thinking being, by not scoring  you can run the clock down, kick a FG, win the game and also deny your opponent the chance of a comeback .   

Now when the Packers player gave himself up, the Detroit defense was going to let the Packers score on purpose, in order to get the ball back but the Packers were wise to that.   
My question is,  before the Packers player gave himself up, could a Lions defensive player have picked up and carried / tackled the Packers RB into the end zone on purpose?",43,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dilqzj/nfl_rules_question_allowing_your_opponent_to_score/,1446.060418597857,r/nfl

"If your QB pulled an Andrew Luck during the offseason, and your team didn’t have a reliable backup, would you get Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston in free agency?","I mean no disrespect to these dudes, but they were both top picks in 2015, and around year 2, they looked like stars, but due to bad decision making and legal issues, and constant changes and major regression, neither are likely to be their starting QB for their team in 2020. Winston just exposed his biggest negative in national TV last week, and Mariota isn’t even a starter anymore. So, yea, it’s unlikely the Titans or the Bucs keep them, sadly.

The “Eye In the Sky” reffing proposition,"* Instead of having 7 refs on the field, have 1 ref on the field and 8-10 watching from video booths, all with different angles. 

* Video reffing takes a lot less skill than traditional reffing, so not only do you not have to worry about inaccurate judgement calls, but you can afford to pay more refs for objectively easier jobs. 

* If the people in booths see something, they quickly rewind a second or two to double check it. Instant mini review just by clicking a rewind button with an interval of 2-5 seconds, then opting back to live viewing. Plenty of time before the next snap. 

* They relay the penalty to the field ref via headset. All refs will be wired into the same line of communication, so if a penalty is relayed by one person that 4 others happened to also see, the 4 others don’t say anything more. 

* Field ref relays that info into the game by throwing flags. He makes no calls by himself.",21,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/digpzn/the_eye_in_the_sky_reffing_proposition/,1897.193752316634,r/nfl

* Jameis Winston threw for 5 INTs overseas, that's a lot. But Verizon managed to out-do that by having 6 commercials in the Giants vs Patriots game on TNF.

&#x200B;

* Marshon Lattimore only allowed 23 yards to the closest receiver towards him according to Next Gen Stats. That wasn't that much if that yardage counted as total non-local commercials, he'd have the 13th most non-local commercials. Also, if the yardage counted as commercials, he would of had less than the 2nd Quarter and 4th Quarter Non-Local Commercial Average.

The rate of penalties has increased pretty dramatically this year.,"In recent years the number of plays run per flags thrown has been increasing, but this year it has gone up pretty dramatically.

&#x200B;

The source I used only goes back to 2009, but from 2009 through 2013, the average number of plays run for each flag thrown varied between 12 and 13. There is a pretty substantial jump going in to 2014, as there were about 11.2-11.5 plays per flag thrown from 2014-2018. This makes sense as 2014 was when the NFL started to emphasize illegal contact in the secondary, including jersey grabbing, picks, and so on.

2019 is looking like a pretty massive jump so far however. Going from 11.203 in 2018, to 9.726 so far this season. According to [The 2019 Rule Changes](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2019-rules-changes-and-points-of-emphasis/), the blindside block was a point of emphasis, but shouldn't have a huge impact as this mainly comes into play of kick/punt returns, and turnovers. Allowing challenges for pass interference was implemented, but this is making no impact as it seems refs just keep whatever was called on the field just about every single time anyway. There was also emphasis on calling the use of a helmet, and offensive holding calls.

It is difficult to say where all of these penalties are coming from however. I am hoping the stats are skewed as teams seem to be more sloppy towards the beginning of the season and this number will improve, as I hate seeing flags thrown, and I hate hearing refs talking during games. The players/coaches should be determining who wins or loses the game, not the refs or penalties.",17,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/didv43/the_rate_of_penalties_has_increased_pretty/,2099.177086166541,r/nfl

\#||Team|Δ|Record|Comment						
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--						
1.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	--	|	6-0	|	The Pats get a long week to recover and retool from Thursday's win against the Giants (TNF -> MNF), and they need it. OL, FB, and TE they will have new faces or new combinations going forward, and will need time to get to fully synced with Tom. Without overlooking the Jets, the Pats are approaching and preparing for the longest stretch of non-divisional opponents of the season, which includes some interesting road games and some quite good teams. The second whack at the Jets on MNF will be probably as odd a game as the first. 
2.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	+3	|	5-0	|	The 49ers have officially marked themselves as contenders for the NFC West crown after beating the Ram in LA. Their record can no longer be dismissed as simply beating up on struggling teams because they have now beaten two straight preseason playoff favorites. The victory included a ferocious defensive effort once again as they held the Rams to just 165 total yards, their lowest total in nearly 2 years. The team looks to avoid a let-down game next week in Washington.
3.	| [](/NO) | Saints | 	-1	|	5-1	|	Sean Payton and the plethora of assistants have been earning their money these past few weeks, consistently gaining an advantage over their opposition. A low-scoring, game-management win against the Jags may not appeal to the highlight reel, but it was likely a dry run for the Bears defense this week.
4.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	+2	|	5-1	|	The Seahawks were overrun early in the battle, and it looked like the day would be lost. However, the boys recovered their footing and shut down the Brown Pants' offensive as the fight wore on, sacrificing just 104 yards of earth in the second half of the skirmish. They intercepted three messages to the front lines and forced an elf to fumble his critical ground attack plan. The counterattack was a resounding success, and Quartermaster Wilson is well on his way to a host of post-campaign honors. His maneuverability and accuracy are unmatched, and Seattle's squadron is 3-0 in road conflicts for the first time in the last 39 years of the war.
5.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	-1	|	5-1	|	There were all sorts of impressive and interesting aspects of this game that would be fun to talk about. Unfortunately, it was all completely diminished by a terrible call that prematurely ended the game. While arguments that there is any sort of bias involved are pretty silly, all fans agree that these types of officiating blunders severely erode their ability to enjoy the sport.
6.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	-3	|	4-2	|	A lot of systematic problems with the Chiefs are rearing their ugly head at once. Poor recent drafting, bad O-line depth, over-reliance on Mahomes making magical plays, and terrible run defense have all slowed the KC's high-flying offense to a screeching halt. The only way to fix these issues for this year seems to be getting healthy and making acquisitions, but that won't help the Chiefs this week when they head to Denver on Thursday night.
7.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	+7	|	4-2	|	On 4th-and-3 with 2:00 left in the game, Bill O'Brien made the call to go for it. This moment and this decision is indicative of what separates this year's team from any Texans squad of the last few years. Not only did the Texans make the ballsy call, they executed it flawlessly. They didn't give Mahomes the chance to make a miraculous comeback (which he probably would have), and the game ended without any further excitement. It was cool, it was collected, and it was a clear sign that the organization has mentally turned a corner. If this team can keep that mentality, they are a serious threat to any other team they'll face this year.
8.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | 	--	|	4-1	|	The hush of the bye week fell over BillsMafia this Sunday. Tables were used for food instead of bodies, beers were sipped instead of slammed, and everybody watched a strange and entertaining week of football from afar. Following another Chiefs’ loss, the Bills are now officially second in the AFC standings. They‘ll look to stay there with three straight home games and six straight against teams that are currently .500 or worse. At 4-1 and heading into the first Miami game, Buffalo has themselves in a position to make some serious noise down the stretch.
9.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	+4	|	4-2	|	[If you haven't seen Kirk Cousins' pre-game speech to Zach Brown, you should.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EG35K7WXUAAmyn0?format=jpg&name=large)  Despite a disastrous start, Cousins is on balance [playing like a top-ten quarterback](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EG2_mfeX0AABT1h?format=jpg&name=4096x4096), leading the NFL's [most explosive passing offense while Dalvin Cook mans the NFL's most explosive rushing offense](https://www.sharpfootballstats.com/explosive-play-rankings--off-.html).

10.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	+1	|	4-2	|	23-17 is extremely misleading about how close the Ravens game was. Before going into victory formation, the Ravens gained exactly twice as many yards as the Bengals and gained 49% more yards per play (6.76 vs 4.54.) The game appeared to be close because of a special teams TD on the Bengal's first possession, and a pseudo garbage time TD at the end of the 4th immediately before a failed onside kick. If you look at all ""normal"" football situations, this was the Ravens bullying an inferior team, which is exactly what contenders should do.
11.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	+1	|	3-2	|	The Bears (3-2) fought to hard-earned tie with Bye Week (0-0-1), mercy killing Kyle Long to IR but also losing Akiem Hicks. They look to have Trubisky back for next week's matchup against the Saints, which is sure to cause comfort and anxiety in equal measure depending on who you ask.
12.	| [](/LA) | Rams | 	-5	|	3-3	|	Despite the 12 new gun control regulations signed into law by Governor Newsom last week, the Rams continually shot themselves in the foot on nearly every drive. Turnovers, penalties, and poor O-line play all came at the worst times, limiting any offensive momentum. Credit to the Niners, who despite still not having played any good teams so far, are the real deal. 
13.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers | 	+4	|	4-2	|	Visiting the Famous Jameis Turnover Factory in regal London, the Panthers came away with a victory and a nice bit of momentum into their bye week. Kyle Allen is playing relatively mistake-free football, but the coaching staff seems to alternate between limiting his downfield attempts and opening up the playbook, which invariably limits the entire offense. They need to see what his limits are to ascertain his true ceiling before Cam Newton returns so as to make the best decision for the team, not the media-driven one.
14.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	+1	|	2-2-1	|	Maybe someone can put their hands to my face so I don't have to watch the NFL anymore.
15.	| [](/IND) | Colts | 	+1	|	3-2	|	A bye week brings a much-needed helping of rest to a banged-up Colts team. Houston looks to be hitting some rhythm, and the AFC South's premier rivalry will see the winner of Sunday's game sitting atop the division.
16.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	-7	|	3-3	|	Leave it to the Eagles’ secondary to make Kirk fucking Cousins look like Dan Marino. There is no positive spin any longer – if the defense continues to play as poorly as it has, Pederson can forget about “winning that football game” in Dallas or any other game against a competent quarterback in the league. The best chance might come if Howie Roseman pays the same referees who officiated the Lions/Packers MNF “contest.”
17.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | 	-8	|	3-3	|	Outscored 47-9 in the first half of the past three games, it’s difficult to find a single bright spot anywhere on the Cowboys. The defense, which was a top five unit last year, allowed an average of seven yards per play to the Jets - the most for any team in Week 6. On the offensive side of the ball, Dak and company failed to find the end zone on their first eight possessions. Philadelphia visits AT&T this Sunday night with the lead for the NFC East on the table.
18.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	+1	|	3-2	|	The bye week was good to Raiders fans. With the Chiefs and Chargers both losing, the Raiders are sitting just half a game back from the division lead.
19.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	+6	|	2-4	|	Defensively, the 2 games before Minkah Fitzpatrick, The Steelers were 0-2 with 2 turnovers and 5 sacks in the two games before Minkah Fitzpatrick. Since then, the Steelers are 2-2 with 15 turnovers (T-2nd) and 20 sacks (3rd). Whatever his presence has brought, it's been huge. Now the Steelers are still near the bottom of the league offensively and are middling in point/yards allowed, but they are making plays on defense. Following the bye week, the Steelers have a very fair schedule for the rest of the season. If they can play the same kind of football as they did on Sunday from here on out, they might turn it around.
20.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	+1	|	2-4	|	The Jaguars, in usual Jaguar fashion, played just well enough to lose. If this team can string together enough of the flashes of talent they clearly have, the wins will come. Until that time, the beatings will continue until morale improves.
21.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	-1	|	2-4	|	The duality of Jameis Winston's play is baffling. After a three week stretch of throwing 9 TDs to just 2 INTs, he goes across the pond to the U.K. and does his best Benedict Arnold impersonation by aiding the enemy with 6 turnovers. Yes, 6 turnovers. Through 62 games, Jameis Winston has turned the ball over 87 times. In the exact same number of games, Josh Freeman turned the ball over 81 times. It goes without say, but Josh Freeman was not the gold standard of NFL quarterbacking. Jameis might not be either.
22.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	-4	|	2-4	|	Coming off of a lackluster performance against Denver, the Chargers responded by performing even worse against a Steelers team starting their third-string QB. For those of you who didn't see the game, don't be fooled by the score. Pittsburgh didn't look like world-beaters, but they deserved to win by much more than they did. This game also not only highlighted the attendance issue for Chargers home games, it may become the prime example. The near entirety of the stadium was pro-Steelers, and you could hear it from the broadcast.
23.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	-2	|	2-4	|	Each week, Browns fans say ""This is the week we find out who we really are!"" and then they lose. But hey, after the bye, we're gonna find out who we really are.
24.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	+2	|	2-4	|	In games where both defenses are good, it's commonly said that whichever team ""blinks"" first, loses. The Broncos and Titans combined for 23 first downs and 17 punts. The teams went a combined 14% on third down conversions. But the Titans turned the ball over more (3 to 1), got sacked more (7 to 1), and failed to capitalize on field position. The Broncos, dead just two weeks ago, have a spark of hope with the Chiefs coming to town on Thursday night.
25.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	-2	|	2-4	|	The Titans defense has let up 15.3 points per game through 6 weeks (5th best in the NFL). but the ""offense"" has only put up 16.3 points per game (5th worst in the NFL), the Titans plan to make a decision on next week's starting QB on Tuesday after benching Mariota during the offensive shut-out in Denver.
26.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	+2	|	2-3-1	|	A strong offensive performance, being on the right side of some questionable calls, and a botched extra point helped the Cardinals narrowly beat Atlanta. Patrick Peterson returns next week and should boost a defense that has struggled to stop anyone (especially tight ends) in the last two games.
27.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	-3	|	2-4	|	To say expectations were low entering Thursday's game would be an understatement. Missing his star RB, WR1, and TE1, Daniel Jones still showed flashes of what made him a top-10 pick. The costly mistakes continue to plague him and the offense as a whole, but he gets a bit of a pass this week since he was going up against the #1 ranked defense with no weapons to speak of. The defense has turned it around a bit, but it's still not where it needs to be. The secondary, in particular, seems to be getting burned left and right each week. Despite losing, the Giants remain one game out of first place in the NFC East and will hopefully have Saquon back in time to face the visiting Cardinals.
28.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	+2	|	1-4	|	In Sam Darnold's two starts this season, the Jets have taken 15 and 16-point leads into halftime, and both games came down to the wire. If the quarterback's return is going to right the ship, Gase is going to need to pair it with more inspired second-half playcalling, but that's a problem for another day. WOO SAM IS BACK AND THE JETS ARE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL!
29.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	-2	|	1-5	|	Fans are saddened by this team in a new, creative way every week, but how can it not warm an Atlantan heart to see former Falcons flourishing across the league? From [Tevin Coleman's stiff-arm touchdown](https://usat49erswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1175601907.jpg?w=1000) to [Corey Peters' sack of Matt Ryan](https://media.giphy.com/media/j3D3fxtwYiYuxyKWym/giphy.gif), it’s refreshing to see those guys finally reach their full potential. What is a harder pill to swallow would be the awareness that careers of 53 talented men are currently being defecated on by a bald-headed, Gus Bradley doppleganger who still thinks he can fist bump his way to job security.
30.	| [](/WAS) | Redskins | 	+1	|	1-5	|	Well, they did it. They beat the worst team in the league by 1 point. Consider yourself on notice, every other team.
31.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	-2	|	0-6	|	Andy Dalton is not the Bengals' biggest issue right now. If a good team is put around him, he can be a good QB. The problem is that the Bengals front office is not capable of putting a good team around him anymore. If the Bengals find themselves with a top-three draft pick, which is looking more and more likely every week, they need to take a long look at the available franchise QBs - Tua, Herbert, or Burrow. 
32.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	--	|	0-5	|	A great job by Kenyon Drake as he sealed the win for the Dolphins with his excellent drop of the 2-point conversion on a play that had no chance to succeed anyway. However,  the Dolphins looked like there may be some competency on the field as they finally covered the spread and put up a good second half, despite conserving [the tank](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDelJwiUYAQ0tIu.jpg) in expert fashion.",995,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/didh1z/official_rnfl_week_6_power_rankings/,2124.9270862340927,r/nfl

We’re mad at the wrong people...,"TL:DR: put an 8th official in the box with 10-15 seconds to look at flags before they are officially announced. 

Everyone on this sub is angry, I get it. You see my flair, you know my perspective. I’ve been on the other side of this too and had the same reaction. We get really mad at the refs for making the wrong call. But I feel like this is misguided, we have 7 humans trying to judge 22 guys in complete chaos. 

On both calls, the hand was high enough for the call, but not in practicality because he was holding onto the jersey hovering above the neck. Bakhtiari sells it as well. Selling it doesn’t make it a foul, but it sure makes it harder to tell. At full speed, are really gonna claim you could get this perfect every time? No. No one could, literally not a single person on earth. 

My point is with every poor call that we see at least 3-4 times in every single NFL game (not just Thursday, Sunday, and Monday night), we all get angry. But why? Why are we angry at the refs for this?

Who we should be angry at is Roger Goodell and The NFL as a whole. They see this, they know the outrage, they know it can cause teams to unfairly lose, but why don’t they do something to fix it? Because the DO. NOT. CARE. They know that everyone of us will be back next week to root on our team and probably watch all the neutral games we can. 

The NFL is so stuck in the concept that calls need to be challenged, thoroughly and completely (ish lol). Why? Why do we need to have an official review process, this is the reason calls like that are not challengeable, it would slow down and maybe ruin the game. 

Here’s my proposal, we add an 8th ref to the booth, with every piece of technology we can throw them. And I’m not saying we review every play, but when a flag is thrown, every ref has a mic to the 8th official. The second the play ends the official that threw the flag tells the 8th official why they threw it in this case just says “90, hands to face”. Then the field officials confer as they always do. Once they come to the decision as they do now, the 8th official who has probably gotten at least two good slow mo looks can say if it’s just flat out wrong. Then they can just pick up the flag. Like it never happened. Not slowing the game down, not over officiating, but just getting the calls right more frequently. On both those fouls, you would have only needed 10-15 seconds of slow mo replay to say they were bad calls. Just pick it up. No challenge. Just move on. And this can be anything, PI, Holding, any foul. And you can set the threshold of reversal down to like 60% confidence because the call on the field wasn’t made yet. If it’s close, leave it. If it’s blatant, fix it. 

Until a system like this is implemented, nothing will change. The game isn’t getting slower, the players are getting faster, officials aren’t going to start seeing the game matrix-style. It can only get worse, especially with the way they are trying to use officiating to make the game safer (which I believe is necessary). 

But, like I said, the NFL doesn’t care. They’re stuck in their ways and the only way they enact change is if they think it will hurt their bottom line not to.",77,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dibatz/were_mad_at_the_wrong_people/,2272.2104201515517,r/nfl

Game of inches vs. Position to win,"With all the terrible reffing taking place you see a lot of the age old saying ""you shouldn't put yourself in a position where one call loses the game"".



This has always upset me as in the same breath we talk about football being a game decided by inches.  These are professional athletes looking to squeeze out every ounce of optimization to beat an opponent who is doing the same. 


How can you say it's a team's fault partially on a bad call because they didn't put themselves in a better position when games are so close? One play completely can change a game, and that is not anyone's fault... are we to believe every team's expectation is to be up by multiple scores so a bad call doesn't affect it? How is that reasonable? 


Good football is close to the wire and every play matters. One blown call can completely ruin the game, changing the outcome and the loser bears 0 responsibility in my opinion.

"The Green Bay Packers are second in the league in beneficiary penalty yards per game, in last place...the Detroit Lions.","[Sauce](https://www.nflpenalties.com/)

Beneficiary yards = negative penalty yards for the other team.

The Packers get 83.5 beneficiary yards per game. The Detroit Lions are in last with 46.8 yards per game.

Not saying there is truth to the narrative but.....

First in beneficiary yards per game is the Colts.

If you look at season totals (Colts and Lions have only played 5), the Packers are in first with 501 beneficiary penalty yards. The Lions are in last with 234.

The Packers are trailed by the Titans in season total beneficiary yards with 456 yards.

"Despite playing only 14 games, the 1948 49ers had maybe the greatest rushing season ever, running for a (still standing) record 3663 yards, and holding second place with 35 rushing TDs (second only to another 14 game team).","As opposed to the 62’ Packers, who hold the record of 36 rushing tds, using Jim Taylor as the true workhorse with Tom Moore as the clear second man, (accounting for 26 tds and 1700 yards on 284 carries) the 49ers had a backfield with a seemingly endless lineup. That season, 6 men carried the ball between 49 and 78 times, with Johnny Strzykalski taking 141 carries. While the leading carrier and rusher, Strzykalski only managed 4 rushing tds (but gained amazingly another 7 through the air). 

HOF FB Joe Perry and QB Frankie Albert would score heavily with 10 and 8 rushing Tds respectively. The four other runners with 50 attempts or more would total up 9 touchdowns, and after that, three more players would score 4 times on the ground. Altogether, they would total up ten scorers. 

Now the yardage individually wont be popping. Strzykalski only had 915 yards (but for a 6.5 ypc which is definitely amazing). And it makes sense. While they ran the ball 603 times, (tying for tenth most in a 14 or less game season) Strzykalski and Perry would be the only guys running more than 5 times a game. But as a whole, there were 10 runners with 100 yards or more, and 6 of them ran for 296 yards or more. And outside of Frankie Albert (running for 5.1 ypc) everyone had a 5.9 ypc or better, with Joe Perry putting up an eye popping 7.3 ypc.

Side note, even dominating the rushing game for that season (running 60 times more than the second place Browns, and 100 times more than half the league) they lead the league in passing touchdowns despite attempting the least passes (only team below 300 attempts) and Albert was fifth in passing yards, and Alyn Beals lead the league with 14 receiving TDs, as well as 5th in receptions.",15,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/diaozg/despite_playing_only_14_games_the_1948_49ers_had/,2313.110420282682,r/nfl

A quick look into Russell Wilson's and the Seahawks ability to win and lose close games.,"Since Russell Wilson came into the league in 2012, I've found myself noticing over the years how often it seems like the Seahawks win or lose games by the skin of their teeth. Obviously, every team is involved in close games, but it seems that Seattle is on another level. This is a testament to how challenging of an opponent the Seahawks have been for the past 7+ years, as well as Wilson's ability to make plays, and the defense keeping games close, even post-LOB.

The first six weeks of 2019 have been no different, as the Seahawks have won their five games by a combined 25 points, and their only loss being 6 points. I'm not a data expert or analyst, but I dug into their point differentials during the Wilson-era, and thought it would be fun to share some interesting stats. A quick note - I only looked at regular season games, and ignored the tie with Arizona in 2016.

* Across the 80 games the Seahawks have won with Wilson at QB, the average point differential in those games is **13.6**. Across the 37 games the Seahawks have lost with Wilson at QB, the average point differential is a slim **7.1**. These have made for many close and anxiety-provoking games that I'm sure have ruined many a liver in Seattle. What more does this mean? I have no idea, but it would be interesting to compare this to other teams with QB stability during the same stretch.
* One of the most dominant stretch of games in terms of point differential and scoring for the Seahawks was in Wilson's first season (2012). Over the course of a three-game stretch, they outscored their opponents 150-30. Had just those three games never happened, the Seahawks average point differential in games where they were victorious drops by more than a full point to **12.5**.
* An average point differential of 13.6 during wins may not seem like anything crazy. The Seahawks, on average, have won their games with Wilson at QB by a couple of touchdowns. **However**, when you consider how many of those games have been close, it gets interesting. **45%** of the Seahawks wins under Wilson have been a point differential of below double-digits, and **43%** have been a point differential of 7 points or fewer.
* The point differential during Seahawks losses is bananas. A whopping **89%** of the games that Seattle has lost with Wilson have been a point differential of below double-digits - and **65%** of their losses have been a differential of below 7 points.

So, what does all of this mean? Nothing, really, except for exciting football. It would be interesting to see how other teams compare during this same stretch, specifically those who have had stability at the QB position. I'm sure the team I cheer for has an average point differential during losses of 50 points. If anyone has data on this that's easy to pull or access, I'd love to check it out.",38,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dia2ba/a_quick_look_into_russell_wilsons_and_the/,2356.6104204853377,r/nfl

The problem with NFL officiating no one is discussing - the game itself.,"If you compare the NFL to other pro sports, the impact of officiating is so much more than any of the others. The reason is pretty straight forward and unfortunately inherent to the game.

If you look at a full NFL season (exclude playoffs for now) you have a 16 game season. Each of those games will net you an average of 12 offensive possesions which means on average you have 192 possesions over the course of a season. If you break it down further, the average number of plays in a game is about 75 per team which gives about 1200 plays in a season. The difference between being 10-6 and playoff bound vs 6-10 and watching from home could easily be accounted for in a difference of 5-10 plays. Keep in mind that there was an average of 7 penalties per game in 2018. Many times, those penalties significantly impact those absolutely critical plays and can be the difference in the game. A bad call can be devastating for a team's season.

Now let's compare that to the NBA for example (although any major sport is fine). On average, each team has 100 possesions per game in an 82 game season for 8200 possesions over the course of the season. Bad calls absolutely happen in the NBA with an average of about 40 whistles a game. Even if you account for 50% of those being a bad call, the impact of the call is a significantly less than the NFL. While the foul directly leads to points in the NBA (unlike NFL penalties) this is not as relevant  because there's more opportunity to score in the NBA. Additionally, due to the law of averages, both teams will likely benefit from a similar amount of bad calls that they usually aren't significantly different over the course of a full season. Maybe your team gets screwed the last game of the NBA season because of a bad call, but chances are you benefitted multiple times throughout the season to get you there in the first place.

This is not the case with the NFL, even the number of plays in a full career pales in comparison the the number of plays in an nba season. The refs make a much more significant impact because of the law of averages cannot take as great of an effect.

Looking at playoffs is even worse as the NFL is one game vs 5 or 7 in the other major sports. This is why you see the best teams in the finals or deep playoffs every year in the NBA whereas the NFL always has cinderellas and high playoff turnovers and superbowl hangovers.

While instituting a 3rd party replay booth may be a better option, everyone must accept that the many games, seasons, champions, and even careers often times come down to officiating and luck. 

TLDR: the game of football is flawed and will always have problems with poor officiating simply because of the design of the game and limited possessions compared to other pro sports.",34,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/di9wft/the_problem_with_nfl_officiating_no_one_is/,2367.993753866355,r/nfl

How this works:  
Each team started with a plot of land. If a team wins a game against a team that currently holds land, the winning team takes all of that land. This map is of where that land has ended up at this point in the season.  

Changes from last week:  
* The Vikings reclaim their homeland from the Eagles.  
* Nope, that's it. Nothing else changed.  

Current Land Leaders (by starting plot count):  
10: Colts  
8: Saints  
4: Raiders, Vikings, Patriots  
2: 49ers  

Games with land at stake (teams with land **bolded**):  
**Vikings** @ Lions  
**Raiders** @ Packers  
Texans @ **Colts**  
**49ers** @ Redskins  
**Saints** @ Bears

US Bank the Bird Graveyard,"When US Bank stadium was being built many people said that it would be a death trap for birds. When it was completed that was proved correct immediately. [It currently holds the record for most bird deaths over a three year span for any building in Minneapolis!](https://deadspin.com/as-expected-the-new-vikings-stadium-is-killing-a-recor-1792819199)

But the less talked about fact is that it is killing the bird teams of the NFL as well. Over the last four seasons the Vikings are 8-0 (including preseason) against bird teams inside of this avian slaughterhouse. Outside of their ominous purple bird trap the Vikings are only 3-4 (including pre-season and post-season) against all bird teams they have faced.

What was the worst call of the week? Nominate what you thought was the worst call made by an official this week.,"The other day I posted this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhleys/forget_a_highlight_thread_there_should_be_a/

Basically the idea is to post a nomination for what you thought was the worst officiating mistake of the week. Based on the top comments I would then like to make a poll to vote and decide which fanbase actually was the recipient of the worst call of the week. I am currently planing on taking the top 5 comments and using those calls in the poll. I would like to keep this open for 2 days and then create the poll using the responses. If there is a post that seems to be getting a lot of late traction I might include that call as well but still also include the top 5 comments in the thread. That is to minimize the fact that the first posts in a thread are normally the most popular by default. Don't want to not include a really bad offender just because it wasn't posted until later. 

Not a requirement but your nomination will probably get more attention if you include a link to the highlight and not just a description of the call. Please note I am not a mod. So I can't enforce any rules in the thread. Downvote what you disagree with. If you see a call you don't think was bad downvote it. If it was really bad then upvote it. 

Have fun, don't resort to personal attacks and may the most unlucky fanbase come out on top! (or is it bottom?)

"[Rapoport] The Patriots are making a move to bolster their tight end position, signing former Giants and Jets TE Eric Tomlinson to their 53-man roster, source said. The knee injury to Matt LaCosse left them a little short.",,80,0.82,https://twitter.com/rapsheet/status/1184042627865436160?s=21,2739.227087903023,r/nfl
Leonard Fournette might be on the verge of a really good season,"At the surface level, he’s third in the league in rushing, which is a nice look. He’s averaging 5.1 yards per carry as well, good for ninth in the NFL overall and third amongst players with at least 100 carries. Even better look.

Digging deeper, Fournette’s average of 3.5 yards after contact per carry leads the NFL by a wide margin for anyone. Dalvin Cook is second in the NFL with 2.8 yards per carry (that’s a difference of .7 YACPC [im really good at math]). For reference, if you subtract .7 from Cook’s 2.8 YACPC you drop to Chris Carson at 2.1 YACPC, ranked 15th in the league. So to recap, the gap from best in the league to second in the league is as big as second in the league to 15th in the league. Very nice. 

Goes without saying, Fournette’s average yards before contact per rush is very bad. Ranked 34th out of 41 eligible candidates according to ProFootballReference, and yet he seems to be killing it regardless.

I like the Jags, I’m a big fan of Fournette as he is one of my favorite college players to come out in a long time . Lack of TDs and relatively small sample size notwithstanding, it seems like he’s playing well according to some stats. But it’s bizarre, because the consensus on this sub/NFL fanbases seems to be that he’s still a borderline bust who is closer to being bad than he is to being good and... I can’t help but somewhat agree? I watch Jags games pretty often and I generally leave the game being underwhelmed. Is this fake news, am I missing something, or has he turned a corner?",21,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/di5hnm/leonard_fournette_might_be_on_the_verge_of_a/,2744.6937545696896,r/nfl

How can the League fix the officiating problem?,"Tonight will definitely be the straw that broke the camels back. Bad calls all season and no accountability for the replay system. It’s really whoever the refs want to win. They make calls where there is no penalty, and refuse to reverse calls despite hard evidence. 

As I understand it, the refs are unionized and so I’m wondering what can even be done? Does the league clean house next season? Does it try to implement more new rules to further convolute the game? 

Something has to change

"What's more impressive, a 4 TD game or a 4 goal game?: An analysis","Pasta's four goal game today [prompted this question on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BovadaOfficial/status/1183834253378969602). I've always liked how TDs scored and ice hockey goals come at similar rates on a per game basis, both for players and teams, and the answer to this wasn't 100% obvious to me, so I thought I'd do an analysis of which is rarer.

**Per Player or Per Game?**

To simplify things, I'm only going to look at how often this happens on a *per team game played* basis and not a *per player* basis.

Although NFL rosters are much larger, it's the six starters at offensive skill positions (including QB) on any given team that have a realistic chance at this. Remarkably, that's the same as the number of ""top six forwards"" per NHL team. So, while you could debate where exactly to draw the line in each, the number of players is about a wash anyway.

I'm also talking specifically about touchdowns **scored**, not four passing TD games, which aren't nearly as rare as either.

---

**NFL Frequency**

For each league, I'm going to look at the regular season for the five prior years as well as the ongoing one.

Since the start of 2014, there have been just *six* games in which a player scored four touchdowns, from the legendary Jonas Gray game against the Colts to Aaron Jones this year, so it happens about once per season: http://pfref.com/tiny/DGPR0

There are 256 NFL games per season, and there have been 91 so far this year, so it's happened six times in 1371 games / in 2742 team games played, or **Once every 457 games**.

---

**NHL Frequency**

There have been 21 such games in the NHL since the 2014-15 NHL season, including Pasta's today: http://hkref.com/tiny/OESkC

Before the Knights joined the NHL, there were 2460 team games per season. The last two years, Vegas brought that number up to 2542. Finally, there have been 166 so far this season ([154](http://hkref.com/tiny/rSWKq) + 6x2 today, including the one that's almost over but not the one that hasn't started yet), which brings us to 12,630 if I haven't fucked up my math.

That means a player has scored four goals **Once every 601 games**.

Sorry football fans, while they're both obviously extremely impressive, a four goal game is slightly rarer.",29,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhyoyo/whats_more_impressive_a_4_td_game_or_a_4_goal/,3386.027089099089,r/nfl

"What if, in 2003, you decided to bet the Patriots against the spread every week? A breakdown.","So I saw someone post that the Pats have been incredible ATS (against the spread) since 2003. Their record is 178-115 ATS since 2003. That's a 61% clip.

So I asked how much money would you have made if you put $50 down on them each game, then reevaluated your bankroll at the end of each season, and kept going.

Typical bankroll management says you should have around 20 bets in your bankroll. So if you're betting $50 a game, you should have $1000 in your bankroll.

So I went through each season since 2003 and did the numbers. (I rounded numbers off, no repeating decimals in these calculations LeRoy.)

The house takes about 10% of your bet, so that how you lose money in seasons they went .500 ATS. (I didn't include pushes into the calculation because they are worthless)

Analyzing the Dolphins' Two Point Conversion Attempt,"We all saw what happened on [the play.](https://twitter.com/NFL_DovKleiman/status/1183475701594370056) But after watching it a few times, I thought it seemed familiar. This is essentially the [same play](https://youtu.be/WwDpHHhDHWs?t=14) the Patriots used to tie the game at 28-28 in Super Bowl 51.  

It's basically a [tunnel screen](http://insidethepylon.com/football-101/glossary-football-101/2015/10/13/itp-glossary-tunnel-screen/) without the hitches, but there are some other slight differences. They both use 10 personnel and go trips left from the right hash, but the Patriots ran the play out of empty and the Dolphins ran it with a single back. The Patriots set up another screen to the right, but the Dolphins chose to send their single receiver to the right on what looks like a fade, but I'm not sure. It's hard to tell because he gets pressed immediately and the play is basically over. 

There are a few things that killed this play for the Dolphins:

* First and foremost, Kenyan Drake dropped the pass. You can't score if you don't catch the ball. One interesting note, though, is that Drake would've caught Fitzy's pass about two yards behind the LOS whereas Amendola caught Brady's pass right at the line, which is where the throw is usually supposed to go on a tunnel screen. Maybe this is exactly how the Dolphins drew it up, but I don't know. Either way, it wasn't executed properly.

* Secondly, the LT whiffed on his block. This play is designed to move quickly, so the edge rusher to the pass side will have enough time to turn back if the LT doesn't take him out. If the LT misses his block, you're turning a 3-on-3 into a 4-on-3 in the defense's favor. So it's a little unfair to compare this to the Amendola score, because Freeney was so far upfield that he basically took himself out of the play (probably because he was offsides). 

* Lastly, one of the blocking receivers didn't do his job. The lower receiver in the stack takes care of the slot defender, but the receiver on top attempts to block the outside CB who is trailing Drake instead of the CB who is pressing him. There is no tunnel through which Drake can travel. 

I don't think this was the worst play the Dolphins could've used here, but it was DOA because of the drop and all of the other things that went wrong. 

Thanks for reading!

tl;dr: The pass was dropped, the throw was too far back, the LT whiffed, and the blocking from the receivers wasn't good enough.

"Prior to yesterday, the Jets were on pace to be the worst passing team in the SB era compared to the league average","Before yesterday, the Jets were averaging 113.5 passing yds/g (net) which was only 46.9% of the 2019 league average (241.81 passing yds/g prior to yesterday). **That percentage was the worst deviation from the league average in any given year in the Super Bowl era.**

After yesterday, however, the Jets are now averaging 156 passing yds/g (net) which is 64.6% of the now 241.56 passing yds/g league average. I think it’s safe to say they won’t be the worst passing team moving forward if Darnold stays healthy.

The highest & lowest number of playoff opponents a team could theoretically face in the regular season,"I was bored recently and decided to figure out the lowest and highest number of opponents a team can face that could end up in the playoffs. 

To find the lowest number, I will use the Saints this season. the Saints schedule broken down like this

* 6 division games
* 4 NFC West games
* 4 AFC South games
* 1 Chicago Bears game
* 1 Dallas Cowboys game

The only guaranteed playoff spots are the NFC South, NFC West, & AFC South division winners. Here is the scenario that gives us the lowest number of playoff opponents possible

* Saints win division, No NFC South teams in the wildcard **(0)**
* The NFC West & AFC South division winners are the only teams from that division in the playoffs. **(2)**
* Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys miss the playoffs, with one wildcard from each of their divisions, or two from one of their divisions as long as they place fourth. **(0)**

In this scenario, the saints will have only played against **2** opponents who made the playoffs.

Now for the highest, I will use the falcons because they won't make the playoffs in this scenario and that makes me happy. Falcons schedule is broken down like this

* 6 division games
* 4 NFC West games
* 4 AFC South games
* 1 Philadelphia Eagles game
* 1 Minnesota Vikings game

They already face the guaranteed 2, and if they lose the division, it gets bumped to 4, because they play 2 against the division winner. But many more ridiculous things are able to take place in order to bump the number higher. this is the scenario with the highest number of playoff opponents possible

* Saints, Bucs, & Panthers make the playoffs. **(6)**
* Any NFC West team wins the division. **(1)**  
* Eagles and Bears both win their divisions. **(2)**
* 3 of the 4 AFC South teams make the playoffs. **(3)**

The Falcons will have played **12** of their 16 games against opponents who made the playoffs. There are 12 teams that make the playoffs every year and the Falcons will have played against 9 of them, 3 of which they played twice. 

This is not very far outside the realm of possibility. 3 teams from one division have made the playoffs a few times, most recently in 2017, and as far back as 1990, when playoffs first became a 6-team tournament. Since the division realignment in 2002, it has happened 7 times. In 2007, both the AFC South and NFC East did it, but they did not play against each other, So facing 12 playoff opponents didn't happen. 

3 teams from one division have made the playoffs 7/32 times or 21.875% of the time. Two cross-conference divisions play each other every 4 years or 25% of the time. The odds that these line up are 5.46%. However, since the two additional conference opponents must also win their division (25% odds each), The odds drop to .34% chance of this happening.

**TLDR:** A team could play as few as 2, or as many as 12 playoff opponents in the regular season.",12,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhuzj0/the_highest_lowest_number_of_playoff_opponents_a/,3641.5270898342133,r/nfl

"Last year, KC had the 7th worst T.O.P and had the #1 offense in the league.","I think arguing that beating the Chiefs using the ground and pound is effective but I think it's been more about the offense than the defense. The Chiefs don't need much time to score.

I think these are the two issues.
Offensive line isn't nearly as good as last year. Missing THEE #1 Pick Eric Fisher has created alot of issues. Erving is a horrible run blocker and below average pass blocker.

Chiefs play soft coverage.
Last year while they couldn't stop much of anything, at least created some turnovers and 3 & Outs. This year for some strange reason are ok letting the team go 10-12 plays eat clock and play everything underneath.

Vita Vea is the best run stopper in the NFL,"Vita Vea is the reason why Bucs are so freaking good against the run this year. His stats don’t show it but he’s an animal on the inside against the run. He gets insane push in the middle that completely stops the run before it can reach the LOS while his team cleans up. 

Game 1: This season Matt Breida has 376 yards, averaging 5.8 YPC. He was held to 15 carries for 37 yards. 

Game 2: CMC has 618 yards, 4.9 YPC; he was held to 16 carries for 37 yards.

Game 3: Barkley got hurt early in the 2nd quarter but he was held to 8 carries for 10 yards before the injury.  In the games he played he has 237 yards, 6.4 YPC.

Game 4: Gurley has 270 yards, 4.2 YPC. He was held to 5 carries for 16 yards. Malcolm Brown has 154 yards this season averaging 4.2 YPC. He was held to 5 carries for 14 yards. 

Game 5: Kamara has 373 yards this season with 4.3 YPC. He was held to 16 carries for 62 yards.

Game 6: CMC was held to 22 carries for 31 yards. 

Bucs played the top 3/4 RBs in the league last season and one of the most productive RBs in the season this year in Breida and the Bucs are holding teams to under 3 yards per carry.

Does Marty Hurney have the best record of 1st round draft picks of any general manager in NFL history?,"This thread is inspired by Brian Burns looking like a future hall of famer, selected all the way at 16.

Literally every 1st round pick he has ever made has been an excellent player, at the top and bottom of the 1st round.  His worst 1st round pick might be Jonathan Stewart, who was still an top tier running back.  The guy drafts nothing but all pros and hall of famers.

If you're young, or not from the Carolinas, you might not know how good Jon Beason, Chris Gamble, or Jordan Gross were.  Cam Newton (gutsy selection at the time) would have been an alltime great quarterback if they (see, Dave Gettleman) had put a competent offensive line around him at some point and not allowed him to suffer 6 concussions per game.  His MVP year showed what he was capable of, was just unfortunate to have a similar arc to Andrew Luck.

Why did we think Zac Taylor was an offensive genius?,"Let's take a deep look at Zac Taylor's coaching timeline:

* After flaming out of the NFL and CFL, Taylor was looking for work
* He **began his coaching career under his father-in-law Mike Sherman** at Texas A&M in 2008
   * In his time from 2008-2011, Sherman served as a a Graduate Assistant and Tight Ends coach
* Mike Sherman was fired from Texas A&M in 2011 but was hired as the Offensive Coordinator for the Miami Dolphins for the 2012 season
   * It seems a bit weird that Mike Sherman was hired as an OC when he was fired from a college team after a super disappointing 4 years at A&M. Let's see how that happened:
      * Philbin is named head coach
      * Philbin hired Sherman to be his OC
      * Previously, Sherman gave Philbin his first job in the NFL when Sherman was the Head Coach/GM of the Packers - So it seems that Philbin was returning the favor
      * Sherman was happy to have his son-in-law tag along
      * *Yes, Nepotism is a common theme here*
* Obviously, Taylor was now in need of work so again he followed his father-in-law and join the Miami Dolphins as an Assistant QB Coach
   * Taylor was promoted to QB Coach in 2013
* Mike Sherman left the Dolphins to coach high school football in 2014 and Bill Lazor was hired
* In 2015, Bill Lazor is fired and our boy Zac Taylor is named Interim Offensive Coordinator
   * **As OC, points decrease 17%, yards decrease 8%, and touchdowns decrease 24%**
   * Yes, this is the same Bill Lazor that Zac Taylor replaced in Cincinnati (Lazor was the playcaller when he was fired)
   * **Taylor's success in Miami was ""developing Ryan Tannehill""** (developing him to what?)
* Dolphins decided to part ways with Taylor and Taylor was hired as OC for Cincinnati after Jim Turner put in a good word to Tommy Tuberville (Cincinnati's head coach)
   * **In his 1 season at Cincinnati, Taylor's offense failed to score a TD in 3 games**
   * **His team went 4-8**
* Taylor was hired as assistant QB coach in 2017 and promoted to QB coach in 2018
   * Taylor studied under McVay but never was the playcaller
* In 2019 he was named Head Coach of the Bengals
   * **Bengals are 0-6**
   * **Rank 29th in points per game**
   * **Rank 32nd in rushing yards per game**

There's a long history of a lack of success in Taylor's coaching past. Let's see some excuses we can make for Taylor to make us feel better:

* He inherited Marvin Lewis's team
* He doesn't have AJ Green
* His offensive line sucks",51,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhqx18/why_did_we_think_zac_taylor_was_an_offensive/,3928.44375756979,r/nfl

At what point do people start holding Telesco in the same light as Grigson?,"Name one fucking year where the Chargers have had a good offensive line in the last five years. Here’s a hint: YOU FUCKING CAN’T!

Every **fucking** year it’s the same damn thing. The fanbase (what’s left of it) begs for a Oline focused draft. What we get instead is more fucking SKILL position players. For fucks sake Telesco you fucking **DONKEY** we already have a top 5 wr core stop spending cap and picks on people like TRAVIS BENJAMIN OH MY FUCKING GOD!

We are literally the reincarnation of the 2014 colts and 2014 cowboys except even LESS people like us, and we won’t learn our lesson eventually because this is “the Charger way”. The GM keeps getting called *”CoUpOn GoD TeLeScO”* by the fanbase while getting paid millions to pretend everything is going well because our offense is putting up 2000 yards a game because Rivers has just enough time to fucking throw a prayer before he gets demolished which results in a 30 yard gain or an interception.

This is NOT fucking ok. We have WASTED the career of a QB who would otherwise have been a HOF on any other team. Guess whose  thrown the most yards without a super bowl appearance? GUESS whose had the most starts without a super bowl appearance?! 

Alright I think that’s enough. I’ll see you all next year after we go 6-10 and draft some hot shot WR for our first pick next year.

"The 49ers are now 5-0 for the first time since October 14, 1990.","Sunday's 20-7 win over the LA Rams put the 49ers at 5-0, nearly 29 years to the last 5-0 start. On October 14, 1990, behind six touchdown passes by Joe Montana, the 49ers defeated the Atlanta Falcons [45-35](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199010140atl.htm) in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.

The [1990 49ers](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1990.htm) finished the 1990 season 14-2 and appeared in the NFC Championship, losing to future Super Bowl champion New York Giants. The head coach that year was George Seifert, and his staff included an offensive coordinator named Jon Gruden.

Of course, the name ""San Francisco 49ers"" was far more accurate back then, because the home stadium was the now demolished Candlestick Park in San Francisco. In 1990, the Rams football team was also based in Los Angeles, five years before the move to St. Louis (and 25 before the return to LA). Although the Rams finished [5-11 in 1990](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/1990.htm), by week 12 they got to be the [first team to give the 49ers an L](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199011250sfo.htm).

Forget a highlight thread. There should be a thread for missed calls each week with a poll for which was the worst.,"Seems like the highlight threads are getting worse each week. I just go to the team subreddit if I want to check out a highlight now or find it myself. Also some really blatant missed calls with multiple people saying their game was the worst officiated game. I say we start compiling the worst calls and then vote. Winner (or really loser I guess) gets bragging rights for their team getting screwed over the worst by the officials that week.

Edit: if I actually did this would people be interested? Was only half kidding and I think it would be fun. Would probably post at noon on Sunday or so and people could start adding any highlights from Thursday if there were some. Would probably take the 5 most upvoted highlights (would include instructions to upvote bad calls and downvote calls you didn't think were that bad) and post a poll on Tuesday to vote on the worst call of the week.

"Strange But True: After six weeks, the LA Rams, who started off the season 3-0, are further out of first place in their division than Washington, who started off the season 0-5","Washington is 1-5, with first place in the NFC East being Dallas at 3-3. They are 2 games back.

LA Rams are 3-3, with first place in the NFC West being San Francisco at 5-0. They are 2.5 games back.

Somehow, with 11 weeks to go, Washington has less ground to make up to win their division than the Rams.

Can we have a discussion about Kyler Murray's final rush today?,"I'm sorry I don't have any link to the play, but with the Falcons having no more time outs, and on 3rd down, Murray rushed right and ran out of bounds with about 1:28 on the clock in the 4th. He was marked down with enough yardage for the first, ending the game. The spot was reviewed and the call on the field confirmed.

However, I can't help but think that there was fairly reasonable evidence to show that Murray was holding the ball well behind the line to gain as the ball crossed the sideline.

Anybody have some more insight on this, and maybe any link to the play?",18,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dhio9h/can_we_have_a_discussion_about_kyler_murrays/,4762.31042611599,r/nfl
