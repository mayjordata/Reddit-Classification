Having a problem with losing teams giving up? How about a bounty system AKA the Gregg Williams Rule,"Saw a couple of posts talking about 0-6 and 1-5 teams giving up and being inactive once they are out of the playoff race. Sure, there are last place punishments or top scorer awards but is that really enough? After thinking about possible solutions, I saw a picture of Drew Brees on the sidebar and I had a lightbulb - what about a bounty system? 

Once a team is mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, bounty rules apply for them if they are matched up against a team in the top 4* seeds. If the eliminated team beats a top 4* opponent, they win $5* . The $5* could be from a side ""bounty fund""* which can be a portion of the league dues (or maybe from the league winner's payout?). Any unallocated ""bounty fund"" money goes to the league winner (or back to the winner). 

*Top X/bounty payout/""bounty fund"" allocation can be modified depending on the number of teams in your league and how your league's dues/payouts are collected/distributed.

"Comparison of TE Numbers Thru 6 Weeks: 2017, 2018, & 2019","Thru week 6, comparing average points per game over the past 3 seasons (half-PPR):

2017  
- 24 TE’s > 6 PPG
- 10 TE’s > 8 PPG
- 5 TE’s > 10 PPG
- 0 TE’s with over 80 total points

2018  
- 21 TE’s > 6 PPG
- 13 TE’s > 8 PPG
- 6 TE’s > 10 PPG
- 3 TE’s with over 80 total points

2019  
- 20 TE’s > 6 PPG
- 10 TEs > 8 PPG 
- 8 TE’s > 10 PPG 
- 1 TE with over 80 total points

Based on the numbers, I question the narrative that says the TE position is “better and deeper than ever” this year. 

Yes, we’ve gone up from *5* TE’s avg > 10 PPG in 2017 to *8* in 2019, but we’ve also dropped from *24* to *20* TE’s avg > 6 PPG. Given the small sample size of 6 weeks, I don’t think either of these changes tell us much of anything. 

I do think we have likely seen more TE “breakouts” (late round / WW TE’s) from year’s past - but simply based on pure fantasy points, I don’t think there’s really anything unique about 2019.

Players to target for the playoffs,"We’re winding up to the trade deadline, kinda, so it’s time to start making final decisions about who you want on your playoff roster. Barring any further injuries or other unfortunate acts of God...or Antonio Brown, here are some guys to consider targeting for the last couple weeks of the season. 

*Note: My league is top-4 playoffs, week 15 and 16. For those of you who play week 17 feel free to add or debate accordingly. I’m here for the discussion.*

&#x200B;

**Golden Tate/Sterling Shepard/Evan Engram** 

In weeks 14-16 the Giants match up with Philly, Miami, Washington. Did you catch that? That’s the three worst secondaries in the league, in a row. Honestly anyone on the Giants offense is a playoff stash, but if you didn’t sell the farm to get Saquon when he got injured then it’s already too late. Unless you have CMC. I do have CMC, but idk, I’m a coward. 

&#x200B;

**Dede Westbrook**

Just listen. Week 15 Oakland. Week 16 Atlanta. DJ Chark has had a wild year. He’s top 5 in fantasy points (.5ppr), top 3 in receiving yards, he’s red hot. I’m not going to be able to offer an acceptable trade for him, so he can fuck off. Did you know that Westbrook has a (marginally) higher snap share AND target share than Chark? Judging by the drops, neither did Dede. He's available in 30% of leagues on Yahoo, but you could have someone use him as trade filler. Nobody really values him but you, smart guy. You clever clever boy. 

&#x200B;

**Josh Jacobs**

Disclaimer, this is the only guy on the list that I already own. But I couldn’t find another RB with two favorable matchups, who may also be available for trade. JJ is reasonably high on the roster trends list, so there’s a chance someone in your league wants to “sell high” after that London performance. I think his ceiling is higher though. If you can get him for Golladay or less, pull the trigger. And speaking of which...

&#x200B;

**Kenny Golladay**

The matchups here aren’t super outstanding, but Golladay has actually done worse against poor defenses this year. In general, this dude is some sort of fantasy Goldilocks. Highly productive, consistent, safe floor but a decently high ceiling. He has the 6th highest target share in the league, and from a talented QB that he clearly has chemistry with. I like Kenny a lot. I really want him on my team and Josh Jacobs is absolutely a reasonable offer, value for value if not more. Anthony I know you’re reading this. You need an RB, I need a WR. Give me Golladay.

 

Anyway, I could go on. Steelers DST have nice matchups. The Browns have a good schedule so feel free to debate OBJ or rehash the Chubb/Hunt issue. That whole organization gives me anxiety.

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Evening, 10/16/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

Does Jalen Ramsey's replacement at CB makes JAX D/ST exploitable?,"Tre Herndon had to be a starter since week 4 when Jalen Ramsey first started missing games.  So he's only a starter out of circumstance and i don't believe he's thought to be their long term solution... Week 1 he gives up 100yds to Emmanuel Sanders and Wk 2 the jags got torched by Mccafrey and Herndon also gave up the 52? Yard catch to DJ Moore. The jags gameplan for the saints focused on  stopping  Kamara( although maybe his injury played a part? ) which they did and I believe they also played more of a Zone D because their personnel can't do man to man. 

Teddy B seemed to be shying away from targeting AJ bouye and focusing on Herndon. Do you guys think JaX D/ST are now a weekly playable matchup ? They Haven't had many takeaways and Herndon looks burnable . And I don't think he was thought to be a long term solution.at LCB .Wondering if week7 at cininatti is more of a Auden Tate game or Boyd, and what happens if AJG plays,  who does Bouye cover?",23,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/diwzks/does_jalen_ramseys_replacement_at_cb_makes_jax/,514.75326739947,r/fantasyfootball

Reddit Consensus Positional Rankings [Week 7] (Supplemental Voting Post),"For those that have never seen these posts before, its a pretty simple concept.  
**1.** Each week I'll create a post on Tuesday morning which will link to 4 voting polls, 1 for each of the following positions QB,RB,WR,TE.   
**2.** Each poll will consist of a list of players at that specific position (18-20 for QB & TE polls) and (40-50 for RB & WR polls).  
**3.** The poll will automatically generate a random match-up between 2 of the players from that position, and ask you simply ""Who will perform better in PPR this week?"".  
**4.** All you have to do is choose who you personally think will perform better, ie ""Score More Fantasy Points"".  
**5.** The Polls are never ending and will continue to generate random 1vs1 match-ups until you eventually exit out.   

**To Contribute toward this effort all I ask is that you spend a few minutes to open up each of the following polls and just vote on a handful of generated match-ups, helping create a more true consensus of /r/fantasyfootball**   

[**RB POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/RBrankingsWeek72019 )  

[**WR POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/WRrankingsWeek72019 )  

[**QB POLL Click Here**]( http://www.allourideas.org/QBrankingsWeek72019 )

Has the Tight End landscape ever NOT been terrible??,"I feel like I see this line is thrown around all the time: ""Man, the tight end landscape is really terrible *this season*.""

I completely agree with that statement. It is. But then I realized I don't ever remember *not* agreeing with it. When I think back on the fifteen or so years I've played fantasy football, I don't ever recall a season in which there was a wealth of quality tight ends available. It seems like there's always 5-to-7 guys you can count on, and then a bunch of drek. 

But am I misremembering things? Was there a glory year for tight ends I'm forgetting about? I mean one where there were at least 12 set-and-forget tight ends.

Devin Singletary ROS Analysis,"I know a lot of people are tired of ""ROS"" posts, especially with a player like Devin Singletary that comes up so often. A few toxic, unhelpful comments inspired me to write up a deep dive on Singletary; to selfishly feed my curiosity as a Singletary owner. Fair warning, it was a lot longer than I had anticipated, though, very fun to write up. 

**In order to look forward, we must first, look back...**

* Devin Singletary was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2019 NFL Draft \[RB the Bills have invested in the most\]
* Bills’ general manager raved about Singletary’s vision and instincts, calling those “rare” traits \[Front office loves him\]
* Coaches reported all offseason that he had an excellent camp \[Coaches believe in him, evident with LeSean McCoy's release\]

**Small Sample Size:**

* Week 1(@ NYJ)
   * No surprise, the veteran Frank Gore started the first game of the season
   * Frank Gore was inefficient on the ground and nonexistent in the passing game; rushing for 20 yards on 11 attempts for a measly 1.8 yards per carry
   * After Gore gets tackled in the endzone for a safety, Singletary took over as the lead back and took advantage of his touches
      * Rushing: 4 attempts, 70 yards (17.5 avg)
      * Receiving: 5 rec on 6 targets, 28 yards (5.6 avg)
* Week 2 (@ NYG)
   * Devin Singletary
      * Rushing: 6 attempts, 57 yards (9.5 avg) and 1 TD 
      * Zero Targets in the passing game
      * Did not receive goal-line work (5'7 203 lbs to Frank Gore's 5'9 212 lbs)
      * Left mid-way through the 4th quarter with a hamstring injury 
   * Frank Gore
      * Rushing: 19 attempts. 68 yards (3.8 avg) and 1 TD
      * Receiving: 2 rec on 2 targets, 15 yards (7.5 avg)

**Since the Injury...**

* Frank Gore has led the Bills in rushing (Weeks 3-5)
   * Rushing: 45 attempts, 245 yards (5.4 avg) and 1 TD
   * Receiving: 4 rec on 4 targets, 22 yards (5.5 avg)
* T.J Yeldon has led the Bill's RBs in receiving (Weeks 3-5) \*Not involved in Weeks 1 and 2\*
   * Rushing: 10 attempts, 45 yards (4.5 avg)
   * Receiving: 10 rec on 11 targets, 100 yards (10.0 avg) 
   * 1 Fumble Lost 

**Now Until the End of Time (or the Rest of the 2019 Regular Season)**

* Since his injury in Week 2, Devin Singletary will finally be active following a Week 6 bye
* Opponent Outlook and Defensive Ranking against the Run though 6 Weeks 

|Week 7 vs. Miami  |31st|
|:-|:-|
|Week 8 vs. Philadelphia |2nd|
|Week 9 vs. Washington  |28th|
|Week 10 @ Cleveland  |29th|
|Week 11 @ Miami|31st|
|Week 12 vs. Denver |18th|
|Week 13 @ Dallas |12th|
|Weeks 14 vs. Baltimore |4th|
|Week 15 @ Pittsburgh  |17th|
|Week 16 @ New England |3rd|

**So...** 

The truth is, while we are all excited about the potential league winner in Devin Singletary, he is going to lose work to Frank Gore. Specifically, goal-line work, which is important for an RB1 to be an RB1. On the other hand, aside from bouts with the Eagles, Ravens, and Patriots, the rest of the schedule offers a lot of favorable RB matchups that compliment the run-heavy offense of the Bills. 

I'm sure the team is excited to get back their promising 3rd rounder who will hopefully take some of the load off Josh Allen, who suffered a concussion in week 4. There is plenty to be optimistic about with the return of Singletary, but, the jury is still out whether or not he will the be the every-down back we hope he will be. Week 7 should paint a clearer picture moving forward as we expect the Bills to run plenty in a lop-sided affair. So cross your fingers, and hopefully, all aboard the Singletary train are on the way to a Championship.",278,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/diuxm7/devin_singletary_ros_analysis/,657.1532678167025,r/fantasyfootball

Why Royce Freeman Could Be Underrated,"I’ll start by saying I hope this isn't redundant, I searched and there wasn't much discussion on Royce.

I’m going through bye week hell and starting Royce Freeman this week. I was just interested in how he was doing this year so I did some digging. 

I mainly made this to make he feel better about playing him, which I actually do now. Maybe you can too. 

I’ll start by saying this isn’t suppose to imply he’s a stud, or as good as Lindsay, because he’s probably not that, but he could be viewed a little differently. I know he is for me now.

#Snap count and team direction

It’s no secret the Broncos want to be a clock controlling running team, and this year they are running the ball far more often than last year. 


Denver plays | 2018 | 2019
---------|----------|----------
Pass % | 61.3 | 56.4
Run % | 38.7 | 43.6

So about a 5 percent increase, which if they kept that up would be a pretty big change. 


Last year the backfield was extremely cluttered, with Devontae Booker pissing off Lindsay and Freeman owners. This year it’s been strictly a two man show, with Royce even out-snapping Lindsay through 6 games. With Booker out is a lot simpler. 


Off Snaps | 2018 | 2019
---------|----------|----------
P. Lindsay | 453 (42%) | 169 (49.5)
R. Freeman | 308 (28.5%) | 214 (54%)
D. Booker | 316 (29%) | 1 (0.3%)


Royce's had his 2 highest snap counts ever, 61 and 62 percent, in 2 of the last 3 weeks. 

___________________


#Now let’s look at his stats

Per game | 2018 | 2019
---------|----------|----------
Games | 14 | 6
Rush | 9.3 | 11.0
Rush Yds | 37.2 | 47.3
Targets | 1.4 | 4.3
Rec | 1.0 | 3.5
Total TD | 0.4 | 0.0
PPR Pts | 7.6 | 10.6


Not a huge points upgrade, but the more value is good and he’s a good candidate for some positive TD regression that would help him out. 

His main are of improvement comes in the passing game, where he basically took all of Booker’s catches. 

He’s T-14th in targets (26) ahead of Zeke, Carson, mixon, tied with Lindsay. On pace for 56 catches - would have been 11th last year. 

Denver is also passing a ton to the RB. Denver RB’s have 5th highest target share 

___________________

**TL/DR:** 

Royce Freeman is thought of as mostly an RB3/4, but his increasing usage (mainly in the passing game) has really gave his floor a boost this year, and he could easily finish as a top 24 RB. He is averaging 3.5 catches a game and out-snapping Lindsay recently. His stats aren’t the sexiest at all and he’s not going to blow up much, but Royce is an incredible handcuff to Lindsay, and has more standalone value than most league mates believe. I think he will another decent day against the chiefs, but has serious upside if Lindsay misses time.",123,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/diuasn/why_royce_freeman_could_be_underrated/,700.3199345310529,r/fantasyfootball

Who has been your biggest draft bust? Of all time and this year?,"We’ve all had those guys that you have high hopes for, yet they always seem to disappoint. Who has been the biggest draft bust for you of all time and this year? For me, the biggest draft bust of all time is Demarco Murray. I drafted him in the second round fresh off of his great year in Tennessee. He then proceeds to have his worst statistical season. This is also the year I drafted Terrelle Pryor and Jordy Nelson. That team blew. Biggest draft bust this year has been Damien Williams. He’s been hurt and has had his touches taken over by Shady and Darryl Williams. I’m bad at drafting.",286,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ditxjd/who_has_been_your_biggest_draft_bust_of_all_time/,724.6532679677009,r/fantasyfootball

DJ Chark vs Bengals Defense,"Been doing some research on whether to start Chark this week against a Bengals D that is surprisingly good against WRs.
Here's what I know:

Chark is currently ranked as the number 2 fantasy receiver.

Last week he was shadowed by Lattimore, holding him to 43 yards.

The Bengals Defense has been the number 5 ranked defense against WRs in fantasy. 

They will be missing cornerbacks Dre Kirkpatrick and William Jackson III when they play the Jags. 

The Jags defense should provide the offense with good field position given the poor performance of the Bengals offense. 

The Bengals Defense is the worst in the league against the run, meaning Fournette and the Jags run game should get a lot of action.

My takeaway, the Bengals D against receivers stat may seem daunting looking at their past performances, but I see this as a juicy matchup for Chark. The only thing tempering my expectation is how much JAX might lean on the run.

Would be interested in hearing from Bengals and Jags fans for any insights.",75,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ditmtn/dj_chark_vs_bengals_defense/,745.2699346820514,r/fantasyfootball

Why are Yahoo! matchup ratings so low effort this year?,"You used to get justifications for whatever 1 through 5 star matchup rating they assigned a player for the week, and they were fun to read.  This year it's always just some lazy readout of some random ass stat that means absolutely nothing for the matchup at hand.

Let's look at a few examples this week:

Josh Allen \*\*\*\* against Miami.  Josh Allen has rushed for 164 yards this season -- 4th most among QBs.  

Cool story, what's this have to do with the matchup?

Deandre Hopkins \*\*\*\* against Indy.  Deandre Hopkins has averaged 13.1 fantasy points per game (37 games) since the start of the 2017 season -- 2nd best of 69 qualified WRs, League Avg:  4.9

Uhh cool stats, how are they relevant to the justification of a 4 star matchup rating?

David Montgomery \*\*\* against Saints.  David Montgomery has broken 7 tackles since Week 3 of 2019 -- 7th most among RBs.

Again, cool irrelevant stat.  How about like you know... ANYTHING about the fucking actual matchup?

What's with the laziness this year?",50,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ditbvc/why_are_yahoo_matchup_ratings_so_low_effort_this/,767.0866014321645,r/fantasyfootball

Now it's just the most vile stuff.  Most of the top comments in good posts seem to have morphed into meme comments.  You used to find a lot of good info and discussion in the comments, but now I have to scroll down to find that, if there even is quality comments.

Has it always been like this and I just am imagining it being different before?  Maybe I'm misremembering, it just seems like there's waaay more low-effort stuff flying around, and stuff like *""I have this player so I agree with this idea.""*

Leonard Fournette is averaging 128 yards and 6 targets per game," His lowest total yardage in a game so far has been 87. While the TDs haven't been as common as we'd like he has still gotten 23 redzone touches through 6 weeks. The rushing volume and pass catching has made him completely matchup proof, he even broke 100 yards against the Saints. Overall just an absurd amount of opportunity for an RB taken in the 3rd round and a huge turnaround since a ton of people wrote him off after the week 3 Titans game. If there is any way to buy him before he goes nuclear this week against the Bengals you should go for it.

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Afternoon, 10/16/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade  

--------------------------------------------------  

*Please remember to keep comments on theme and, as always, Subreddit Rules 5, 8, 9, and 10 are in effect.*

If you'd like to discuss something outside of this theme, please try checking the [latest Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day) for a thread that might be more suitable for you. If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

"Official: [Simple Questions and League Issues] - Wed Afternoon, 10/16/2019","**DO NOT post Who Do I Start, Add Drop, or Trade questions in this thread; find the appropriate thread within the [INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day).**

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"With the news of Fitzpatrick starting, take a look at Albert Wilson","I know the Dolphins are a dumpster fire, but that should actually help Wilson since they'll be playing from behind. Since 2009 Fitzpatrick has the highest rate of passes thrown to slot receivers, a whopping 26. 4%. Wilson had 4 targets on the first drive in week 1 with Fitzpatrick before getting injured. I'll be taking a flier on him.",39,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dirb2g/with_the_news_of_fitzpatrick_starting_take_a_look/,905.3699351509412,r/fantasyfootball
Christian Kirk outlook,"Now he has probably been talked about in depth this year but here is a refresher for those who need a good wideout. Christian Kirk currently has 37 targets on the year. That ties him with Josh Gordon, 1 target less than Thielen and 3 less than Lockett. The part that makes it even more impressive is Kirk hasn’t played for the last 2 1/4 games.

Even without playing the last 2 games Kirk still owns a 15% target share for the cardinals on the year. As well he owns 10% of the red zone looks. Kirk can very well be the breakout player we envisioned when drafting him this year. 

With the emergence of Kyler Murray, a somewhat competent Oline and a good DJ/edmunds combo the offense should thrive. That’s where Kirk should see a steady dose of targets per usual but also a good amount of red zone looks (he should be the number 2 leader in targets behind DJ).

Pair all of this up with a very favorable schedule and a shaky cardinals defense should lead to some pass heavy games. Buy Christian Kirk in any league you can before he potentially suits up this week. He can be a solid WR2 with WR 1 upside.

Sorry for the wall of text
Also side note take a decent look at Auden Tate he could be good.",43,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/diraso/christian_kirk_outlook/,905.8199351668358,r/fantasyfootball

So far in 2019, this comparison still is accurate, which I find to be hilarious. I stumbled across the old post I made last night, and it's still a very accurate comparison.

Sanu total points in 2019: 69.3 points (in PPR)

Question about auction leagues,"i have never played in one but some guys in my league have expressed interest in switching. im pretty sure i have and idea of how drafts work but if anyone can guve a good explanation on that it would be cool too. im also wondering about waivers. 

does every team get one bid per pick up or is it unlimited bids until  a certain time set by the commish. is it possible to do a snake draft and have auction waivers. 

im the commish of my league and like the idea of the auction format but would like some more information on how things work and maybe some suggestions on how it works. currently on espn but im pretty set on switching platforms next year, what would be the best one to accommodate an auction league?",2,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dir55r/question_about_auction_leagues/,916.9532685319583,r/fantasyfootball

Week 7 OAQ's (Overly Asked Questions),"With a sub this size there is naturally always going to be repeat questions/posts/threads, but I've noticed a trend lately that the repeats are becoming WAY more frequent, and it's obvious a lot of people do not know where the search bar is.  I'd like to make this thread today to cover some of the most overly asked questions I see on here not just daily, but hourly:

**WEEK 7 OVERLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

* **CHIEFS BACKFIELD** - The Chiefs are in a full blown RBBC and nobody has any idea the thought process behind the utilization of either McCoy or either of the DWill's.  You are rolling the dice every time you start one of them and you know it.

* **BROWNS BACKFIELD** - Chubb is awesome.  Hunt hasn't played in about a year, was injured during training camp, will no doubt be rusty when he's back, and there's no guarantee he sees much playing time.  That being said, I'm a firm believer in every player is for sale for the right price.  If you can get great value for Chubb, go for it, but everyone and their mother knows Hunt is coming back so I'm sure you'll get low balled.  Just enjoy your RB1.

* **PATRIOTS D/ST** - Yes, Patriots D owner's should all be quite aware by now that their cash cow is going to run into some legitimate starting QB's and offenses in a few weeks.  Either ride them out, or go get the Jets D, as mentioned 4,000 times this week.

* **CHARGERS BACKFIELD** - Not quite the mess that the Chiefs backfield has, but it's close.  This one is more cut and dry.  If the Chargers are ahead, MG3 will see the ball more.  If they're behind, Ekeler will see the ball more, and he's not going away anytime soon.  Workhorse MG3 is no longer a thing barring injury to Ekeler, but you knew this was coming when he decided to hold out.

* **PACKERS BACKFIELD** - This one is close to home since I am a Packer fan.  The 50 pt outlier game from Aaron Jones isn't happening while Williams is healthy.  The Packers are a better team when both of our RB's are playing (and when the refs call phantom hands to face penalties), so that will not change.  If you have Aaron Jones, he's still the better player, best bet to lead the team in carries, and an every week RB2 with RB1 upside.  There's nothing you can do about it now, you're playing him every week.  Williams has flex value in the right matchups, but his floor is 5 or less, so good luck, but this week against the Raiders is one where he can be started.

* **SELLING HIGH ON PLAYERS** - Every time someone has a good game the ""Should I sell high on player X"" fairies come out to play.  Each case is different, but there are some simple things you can do to research if a player is worth selling high.  Again, EVERYONE is for sale for the right price.  Nobody knows what you can get in your league for any given player, so you'll have to figure that out on your own.  Factor in circumstance, schedule, injury history etc., but only you can decide what is worth it to your specific team needs.  But, the majority of the time, the answer is STOP!  Take your points from your good players and move on.

* **PLAYER X ROS?** - If anyone on here knew what the outcome was for any given player for the rest of season, they'd be a multi-millionaire.  Make your best judgement calls.

* **PLAYERS TO STASH IN IR** - Brees, Njoku, Guice, Cam,  maybe more depending on league/roster size.  Again, something you can find on your own within your league.

* **PLAYER X IS A GOD!** - Yes, we know that Cooper Kupp and Chris Godwin are very good and you got great value.  Good job!

* **SHOULD I SEND PLAYER X FOR Y?** - Go fuck yourself.

V1per's Week 7 Survivor/Eliminator Pick,"Last week saw big upsets around every corner. Chiefs (-5), Falcons (-2.5), Cowboys (-7), and Chargers (-7) were all popular picks last week that lost. My NE pick from last week survived the culling and we continue on with just the one loss.

If you've selected different teams up to this point, make sure to check out the downloadable excel file is available at the bottom to enter your own teams and run it for yourself.

**I don't care about stupid math stuff, just give me the team**

Fine. Buffalo Bills

Last week was a tough one to get through, but the schedule really opens up ahead. Using the Bills at home against a winless Miami team that just lost to winless Washington seems like the obvious choice. For those of you who don't like picking the most popular team, San Francisco, GB, and NE are all big favorites this week as well.

**Season so far**

5-1.

Had a nice bounce back this week, getting the win and avoiding the chaos of upsets on Sunday. The schedule opens up quite a bit from here with only 3 games below an 80% chance of winning.

**Season Long Outlook**

Teams in italics are changes from last week. This is simply to give some insight into why team X or Y aren't being picked this week. It's usually because they are better off being used later in the season, or it's because I've already used them.

&#x200B;

|Week|Team|P(Win)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|PHI|100%|
|2|BAL|100%|
|3|DAL|100%|
|4|LAC|100%|
|~~5~~|~~KC~~|~~0%~~|
|6|NE|100%|
|**7**|**BUF**|**92%**|
|*8*|*PIT*|*86%*|
|9|HOU|75%|
|10|IND|88%|
|11|SF|84%|
|12|CLE|84%|
|13|CAR|84%|
|14|GB|85%|
|15|NYG|75%|
|16|SEA|84%|
|17|LAR|79%|

 

The only change is the week 8 pick. We're now swapping out the Saints with the Steelers Both games are fairly equal currently at 86 vs 84 percent chance of victory, so this could easily change back based on this week's results. 

Now that we are getting a better idea of who the good and bad teams are, along with using up many of the better teams already, we can expect the future predictions to stay pretty consistent. If the Rams continue to struggle we might be in a tough spot come week 17.

**Nerdy Math Stuff**

P(Win out) = 13.1%

E(Wins) = 14.16 (+0.17) -- Yup, I'm expected to lose two more games this year

**Methedology**

I get team win percentages from 538 for every game in the entire season. I update probabilities for the current week based on Vegas betting lines to better take into account current team situations that 538's computer models can't account for.

With all of these values, I run something called the Hungarian Algorithm which solves the best possible choices to maximize the total win percentage values. This makes sure to use each team when it's optimal to do so.

The method used for this maximizes your chance of making it through the whole season undefeated. This is ideal if you are in a very large (70+ person) league. If however, you are in a small league that is unlikely to have everyone make it to the end and the last person standing is the winner, than the above picks will be less than ideal. If you're in one of these smaller leagues, download the file below, enter your league size and get the team list specifically for your league.

**Download**

After getting a lot of ""What if I picked teams A and B already?"" or ""What if there are only 20 people left in my league?"" or ""What if I can only pick teams that play on Sunday?""

I got you covered. I cleaned up the sheet and added a couple of features that should work for everyone.

You can download it from [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/weaecfmprbe6hv4/NFL_Survivor.xlsm/file).

Air Yards per Game(Top 10),"We've seen the kind of fantasy points WRs can put up when they're getting a lot of air yards. Here's a list of the top 10 air yards per game for receivers.

Mike Evans - 138

Kenny Golladay - 120

Will Fuller - 116

Julio Jones - 111

Keenan Allen - 108

OBJ - 107

Chris Godwin - 106

John Brown - 106

Curtis Samuel - 106

DJ Chark - 104

A pretty solid group to be a part of and one name that stands out going into this week is John Brown against Miami. Since Week 1, he's been pretty quiet but has a nice opportunity for a big game this week.

D/ST streamers...where does your combined D/ST rank so far this season?,"I thought this could be a fun post to see how effective people have been at streaming D/ST this season. I’m a firm believer in the strategy, although I do wish I had the Patriots’ this season. 

I’ll go first. 

Week 1: Bills D/ST 11 points

Week 2: Browns D/ST 12 points

Week 3: Cowboys D/ST 11 points

Week 4: Colts D/ST 2 points

Week 5: Titans D/ST 7 points

Week 6: Titans D/ST 6 points

A total of 49 points, good for the 8th best D/ST on the season. I really flopped picking the Colts in week 4 (if I had gone with my other options my D/ST would be top 5), but for the most part things have gone ok. I haven’t streamed any insane performances this season and somehow I’ve avoided picking a D/ST that scores a TD, but I have the 9ers lined up for this week so I’m hoping that will change.

Minnesota-Induced Brain Worms,"DISCLOSURE: Diggs owner :)

&#x200B;

I cannot for the life of me understand a point I'm seeing over and over this week about Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. The common refrain appears to be ""the last two weeks were squeaky wheel games and now they'll go back to being unplayable so sell them both while you can.""

&#x200B;

Am I the only one who thinks this logic doesn't make any sense? Do we really think Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs are going to be satiated because they were involved in the offense for 1-2 games out of 16? Of course it's unrealistic to expect 130 yards out of Thielen or 3 TDs out of Diggs every week, but the idea that they're going to immediately return to 2-3 catches per game for 30-50 yards for the rest of the season and be perfectly content seems crazy to me. Further, the shift in play calling that occurred in Weeks 5 and 6 is way smaller than what people seem to think:

&#x200B;

Weeks 1-4 the Vikings averaged 30 rushing attempts per game, Weeks 5-6 they averaged 34.5.

Weeks 1-4 the Vikings averaged 25 passing attempts per game, Weeks 5-6 they averaged 28.

&#x200B;

The past two weeks haven't been the Vikings abandoning their run heavy philosophy to satiate disgruntled diva wide receivers, it's higher quality passing attempts on deep to intermediate routes, as opposed to shorter routes and checkdowns. This is supported by their Yards per Attempt going from 7.5 in Weeks 1-4 to 10.75 in Weeks 5-6. Considering their next 4 opponents are average at best when defending the pass, I don't see a great reason this formula would change. It also helps matters that this more aggressive passing attack played a large role in comfortable wins both weeks. 

&#x200B;

Am I crazy? Can someone explain what I'm missing? Did Minnesota's coaching come out after Weeks 5 and 6 and talk about how painful it was for them to not call a ton of 5 yard curl routes?",20,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/diq1o3/minnesotainduced_brain_worms/,997.3199354847272,r/fantasyfootball

Dawson Knox and TE’s,"It’s already that time where the good TEs are taken and we’re scrambling for an answer. Is Knox a viable start this week against the Dolphins and ROS? 

He’s pretty much only received about 5 targets per game but he hasn’t shown a big blow up such as Hockensen has done. The talent is there but the stats aren’t showing. What your thoughts?

Any other good TEs for pickup you have in mind?",54,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dipsxa/dawson_knox_and_tes/,1016.2032688498497,r/fantasyfootball
Robert Woods,"Woods has not quite been the player he was drafted to be so far, his safe floor from last year is slightly less safe. There is reason for optimism in the near future, however, as I believe he can provide some solid performances the next couple weeks. 

**Positives:**

*Matchup*

Atlanta has a terrible defense, allowing around the 5th most points to WR's per game. Also they have given up at least 1 receiving TD to a WR in every game this year besides Arizona. Put that together with the fact that their offense puts up points and you have great potential for a shootout. After Atlanta he gets Cincinnati, if he can't produce with these two matchups then it will be severely concerning. 

*Numbers*

Woods has been on the field for at least 90% of snaps every game this season. He is also comfortably in 2nd place for targets on the Rams behind only Kupp. Woods has 51, next closest is cooks with 37. 

I also believe he has had multiple touchdowns called back for penalties, don't have exact data on this Id appreciate if someone could clarify this. 

*Rushing Attempts*

Kind of a neat quirk for Woods is that he's gotten a decent amount of rushing attempts this year, finally paid off against SF when he scored. He has 7 rushing attempts in total this year. Not necessarily significant but I think its a cool perk. 

**Negatives:**

*Red Zone Usage*

Only 4 RZ ""looks"" this year, tied with Higbee and behind Everett, Kupp, Brown, and Gurley. 

*ROS schedule*

According to fantasy pros, the rams face the 8th hardest schedule for WR's the rest of the season. 

**Conclusion:**

Woods is in a great spot for the next two weeks. The matchups are working in his favor and I believe he is in a prime position to succeed. If you're in a league that trades Id consider moving him soon because after the bye their schedule is rough.

Defense Wins Championships - Empire State Edition,"A strong defensive outing can help give you an extreme competitive advantage. For this reason it is important to roster defenses with favorable matchups as the likelihood of strong defensive outings increases.

If you have the luxury of rostering 2 defenses now then I strongly encourage you to take a look at picking up the NYG and the NYJ.

If you are to play them starting this week you will have the following match-ups:

Week 7: Arizona

Week 8: Jax

Week 9: Miami

Week 10: NYG/NYJ

Week 11: Washington

Week 12: Oakland

Week 13: Cinci 

Week 14: Miami

Week 15: Miami

Week 16: Washington

Most know by now that NYJ D/ST alone is a must add at this point. HOWEVER, The combination of both these New York Defenses can give your team an extreme competitive advantage for the rest of the season and most importantly for the playoffs.

Is Tyreek Hill's value the highest it's going to be?,"Let's talk facts here: teams have figured out how to beat the Chiefs. Possess the ball and don't get into a shoot out. 

Does this hurt Hill's value?

I know he a special kind of player but their schedule contains a BARRAGE of run heavy offenses that will likely just run the ball down their throats and keep the ball away from them. And with so much talent on one team, if you're possessing the ball less, there are less opportunities for Hill to feast

And then look at his playoff schedule.

Double your pleasure and double your fun with Pit/NYJ Defensive combo.,"TL;DR - You might get good production from a Pit/NYJ DST combo the rest of the year....see graph.

Caveat, I did this research because:

1. I over think things and the thing I'm overthinking right now is that my NE defense is about to hit a rough schedule in 3 weeks (maybe I'll trade them)
2. Shits and giggles

Basically, I looked at the some top defenses that are available: Det, Pit, GB, TB, Hou, NYJ and looked into using them as fill-ins if NE DST starts sputtering.  Note, there may be even better matchups among other low-owned defenses...but the ones above are what I looked at.  I then rated them based on their matchups. The graph below is what I came up with.

The green highlights are opponents within 2 of the best matchup for that week.

Graph: [https://i.postimg.cc/FF2Nb6Bj/NE-defense.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FF2Nb6Bj/NE-defense.png)

You'll notice how nice the NE matchups have been so far and how it just ends abruptly. I have to add that part of the reason these teams are rated so poorly is partially \*because\* NE scored a ton against them...please don't ignore that. Anyway, continuing. What stuck out at me was the easy schedules for Pit (25% owned) and NYJ (8% owned) and how they compliment each other really nicely. Jets are a good defense so far (8th best in avg score) with scores of 18,5,16,3,1 in my league, but the 3 was against Phi (9th) and 1 against Dal (2nd) so they were tough games. 18 and 16 against Buf and NE show lots of promise. The Steelers are currently the 5th best defense against a decent set of opponents \[NE 14, Sea 16, SF 13, Cin 24, Bal 4, LAC\]. They are 25% owned elsewhere. But they are on BYE so I expect even more people to drop them. I know you're not supposed to keep a defense on your bench as a generally hard rule, but you're also supposed to not lose and all these people telling you not to bench a defense lose all the time, so to hell with them. Lets think outside of the box here.

Starting week 8, if you have both Pit/NYJ, your opponents would be:

Mia (32)

@Mia (32)

NYG (28)

@Cle(27) | @Wsh (26)

@Cin (24)

Cle(27)

Mia (32) (Drop NYJ after this)

Buf (29)

@NYJ (31)",136,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dinyc9/double_your_pleasure_and_double_your_fun_with/,1175.7699356834094,r/fantasyfootball

"Official: [Wednesday Weekly Trade Value] - Wed Morning, 10/16/2019","#Wednesday Weekly Trade Value Thread

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade

If you still don't find what you're looking for, [search new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) before posting your own thread, and as always please follow the subreddit's [Rules and Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/wiki/rules_guidelines) in all your activity.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

Best Source for Fantasy News?,I only casually play fantasy and am mostly a regular football fan. Like many people I am familiar with Rotoworld. However I can no longer stand their constant hot takes and opinion pieces. They are the home of fake Football news. I haven't forgotten them trying to pump up players like Martavis Bryant as the next big thing even though it was so obvious it wasn't going to happen. This season after an exodus of the regular writers they replace them with some of the worst yet. So I'm here to ask if they're any good alternative the Rotoworld for Fantasy Football news thank you,10,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dinifr/best_source_for_fantasy_news/,1219.2532692352931,r/fantasyfootball
Reddit Adjusted Fantasy Football Trade Values Week 7: Hunter Henry is back!,"Welcome back to another week of fantasy football. Felt like a weird week, but maybe that was just me. Some top tier WRs are still under-producing, but I would still try to buy low. The chargers looked like a bottom 5 team and I would not be buying them. Jets had some life with Darnald back!

To generate trade values, I combine [Harris football](https://www.harrisfootball.com/ros-ranks) rankings with [Fantasypro](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/ros-overall.php?filters=8a133a36fe) rankings and apply an algorithm I wrote based on historical values and trends. Next, I average these values with [CBS](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-week-7-trade-values-chart-rest-of-season-rankings/) and [4for4](https://www.4for4.com/) values (if applicable) to normalize across the industry. Lastly, I apply a PPR correction factor and create the 0.5 PPR values as well. I generated my functions by using historical data, Reddit Trade threads, and the Yahoo trade market. My goal was to look for crossover points in 1 for 1 player positional trades to generate tiers and normalize across positions. My goal is to incorporate as many sources and experts as possible to eliminate or minimize bias.

As I discussed previously, I believe the experts have a lot of bias towards the top, bottom, and between the positions. I check the comments on the expert's articles every week and see the disapproval and outright anger at some of the rankings. My goal was to try and adjust the values using crowd-sourced data (Reddit+Yahoo) to create better trade values.

*Significant Updates:*

none

*Key Assumption:*

12 team: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 TE/WR/RB.

*FAQ:*

“Where are the standard or PPR values? “

Answer: Change the tab or the spreadsheet, or scroll down on the image.

“What is the QB value in 2-QB leagues? “

Answer: Double the QB values and it will be close

“What does 10-team league do to values?”

Answer: Smaller league means higher tiered players are worth more. Tiers 1-3 go up and tiers 6-7 have very little value.

“What about 3 WR leagues?”

Answer: WRs value increases due to slight drop in scarcity

“Where are the defenses?

Answer: Defenses don’t matter to the experts. Patriots and Bears have value. Hard to quantify

“Why is X player so low?”

Answer: Because you own them and god hates you

“How do I use this chart?”

Answer: Add player values on each side of the trade and compare for fairness. That simple.

""Did you mean to spell X wrong?""

Answer: No, spelling is hard. I do science and stuff

“What about Dynasty, bro?

Answer: Dynasty is a completely different beast. Maybe next year homie

“What about keeper and draft picks?”

Answer: Great Question. I do not know. Keepers change the trade game. I do not factor them in. Draft picks are tough to quantify as well. I think you can estimate a value by averaging the values of the 12 players on the chart corresponding to the round. (Example average players 1-12 to get a first round pick). Then, you would need to weight the value to include rest of season usage and uncertainty in the draft pick next year. So many 50% of the average is what I am guessing. All this is theory.

TL:DR.

Are all receivers outside of Davante Adams not rosterable in the new GB offense?,"Haven’t got a chance to watch a lot of the Packers games but it looks like the offensive scheme has drastically changed under new Head Coach Matt LaFleur. 

The team has really ramped it up on the defensive side as evidenced by their acquisitions over the summer. Additionally, it looks like Rodgers is underperforming since he’s not passing the ball as often has he has (based off of his passing yards per game). Because of this, the receivers either haven’t shown up (especially in Adams’s absence) or have been extremely boom/bust. 

Because of this, are guys like MVS and Geronimo not worth holding on to? They have had a perfect opportunity to shine in Davante Adams’s absence but their performance has just not been there.",45,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dinfsw/are_all_receivers_outside_of_davante_adams_not/,1227.1699359138806,r/fantasyfootball

The Cowboys face some tough defenses soon and I think Dak might opt for more safe passes to the veteran. If Cooper is out this week I think Witten could tie for top in targets again and he's proven he can still handle the workload.

Shady’s Thursday Night Special,"While most people have discounted Shady and the chiefs RB, I was actually looking forward to starting him over the next game.

Case study: the last two chiefs games, they played actual contenders, colts and Texans are going to the playoffs. They have good enough offenses (and coaches in the case if the colts) to actually play keep away from KC. Denver DOES NOT. They have a very mediocre offense.

I feel like the chiefs get up early and run the ball which means lots of opportunities for the 31 year old RB.

This is probably getting downvoted into oblivion but fuck it! All I want to say is don’t let two games make you discount the chiefs, Reid has been a HC for a decade or more for a reason, there will definitely be something changed to account for their short comings (he’s only the worst in game coach, he’s probably the best between game coach)",71,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dijqko/shadys_thursday_night_special/,1629.0866027196248,r/fantasyfootball
Don't Chase Points: the Patriots Defense Edition,"Nobody can predict what's going to happen in fantasy football. We can all have varying opinions on who is better than who, what matchups might mean, and it's a lot of fun to argue. BUT that does not mean that we can't make some predictions about the future. If you want to be good at the game, you need to recognize when logic and data actually do matter, and make decisions accordingly. One of the easiest traps that we fall into is **chasing points.**

It's not always bad to go with the hot hand. A great example right now is: Hopkins v. Godwin. Even though Hopkins had the pedigree and the pre-draft capital, I couldn't blame you for making that trade. We have every reason to expect Godwin will continue his pace, and there are some legitimate ways to frame the Texans offense this year that indicate a down year for Hopkins. Chasing points, in this sense, is not necessarily wrong. But in some cases, it is wrong.

**If you are being offered a starter-caliber player for the Patriots defense, you take it.** This post was inspired by someone who traded Hopkins for the Patriots defense. Not only this, but it was *defended* on here. Don't make this mistake.

At the outset: the Patriots defense has had a historically good start to the season. After six games, they have 25 sacks, 14 interceptions, 2 fumble recoveries, 2 blocked kicks, and 5 touchdowns. If you drafted them, **well done.** You are probably sitting pretty right now. But just know that week-to-week fantasy defensive production is simply not predictable, even when the defense is a juggernaut in real life.

Obviously they've had a cakewalk of a schedule. Against their toughest opponent, they only had 1 sack, 1 INT, and no touchdowns or fumble recoveries. They racked up insane stats against the Dolphins, Luke Falk's Jets, the Bills (probably their most impressive performance), the Washington excuse for a football team, and the Giants' rookie QB without Saquon, Engram, Shepard, or Gallman. This simply does not convince me that they are a defense of the caliber of the Bears last season or the Jags the year before. I'm not even convinced they're a better defense than the 49ers or Bears this season.

But even if they were, defensive scoring is just so difficult to predict. Game-by-game adjustments happen; difficult matchups happen; and on top of all that, a defense can perform extremely well and still not get a lot of fantasy points if they force incompletions and stuff runs all day. Recent history is a great illustration. Here are the **Championship Week (16) performances** for the highest performing fantasy defenses heading into week 16 in the past years:

**2018:** The Chicago Bears, averaging 12.6 fantasy points per game, were a powerhouse defense going against the 4-10 San Fransisco 49ers. This was a dream matchup for the fantasy defense MVPs. What happened? The played great, as expected, and won 14-9. Only problem is, their suffocating defense only actually got 1 sack, 1 INT, 0 FR. No touchdowns. Around 5-6 fantasy points. Meh.

**2017:** The Jacksonville Jaguars, averaging 13.6 fantasy points per game, had carried people all year. They also (weirdly) went against a 4-10 San Francisco team. Again, dream matchup for the fantasy defense MVPs. What happened here? Absolute stinker. The Niners put up 44 points, and the Jags got 1 sack and 1 INT. 0 FR, 0 TDs. Negative points in most formats. Ouch.

**2016:** The Minnesota Vikings were #1 in fantasy defensive scoring at 10.9 points going into week 16. This year it wasn't a ""clear dominant"" team but they were #1 at that point. What happened? They let Green Bay score 38 points, with no INTs or FRs. They did manage 4 sacks, for maybe 1-2 fantasy points (depending on format).

**It goes on... (2015:** Denver Broncos, 17 points allowed, 2 sacks, 1 FR, 0 INT, 0 TD, **2014:** Philadelphia Eagles, 27 points allowed, 2 sacks, 1 INT, 1 FR, 0 TD, **2013:** Kansas City Chiefs (averaging 15+ a game), 23 points allowed, 1 sack, 0 FR, 0 INT, 0 TD).

I think you get the idea. Fantasy defensive scoring is simply not predictable, and valuing the Patriots defense for what they have done to date is the definition of chasing points. Let someone else do it.

Edit: MORE DATA! How about this:

In the past seven seasons, eleven fantasy defenses have averaged 13 or more points per game heading into week 7 (where we are now). ZERO of these ten kept up the pace. The average drop off was over seven points per game. That’s a huge statistical drop off. Right at 50% drop off, on average. Here are the data points:

"Whose your biggest ""get right game"" this weekend for an underperforming big name player?","I think this weekend has a few big performances in store for some guys who have ""underwhelmed"" lately. Some guys that come to mind for me are: 

Travis Kelce vs DEN- Coming off of back to back losses for the chiefs, I firmly believe you can't stop this offense 3 weeks in a row. With Tyreek Back I really think Kelce finds the endzone and upwards of 70 receiving yards, even with Denver's solid D. 

Robert Woods/Brandin Cooks vs ATL- You aren't going to find a better shootout this weekend then this game, both teams having something to prove after a horrible stretch of weeks. I think Woods and Cooks really are the main beneficiaries of Atlantas super suspect secondary 

Keenan Allen vs TEN: Yes TEN is pretty sound defensively, but now that Hunter Henry is back healthy and looking dangerous, teams are going to be less zoned in on Allen, and more aware of Henry, especially in the redzone. Not to mention the more comfortable MGIII gets in this offense, the more teams have to respect a his running ability. Getting the run game early for the Chargers should open up more play action abilities for Allen.

**1.** Each week I'll create a post on Tuesday morning which will link to 4 voting polls, 1 for each of the following positions QB,RB,WR,TE.   
**2.** Each poll will consist of a list of players at that specific position (18-20 for QB & TE polls) and (40-50 for RB & WR polls).  
**3.** The poll will automatically generate a random match-up between 2 of the players from that position, and ask you simply ""Who will perform better in PPR this week?"".  
**4.** All you have to do is choose who you personally think will perform better, ie ""Score More Fantasy Points"".  
**5.** The Polls are never ending and will continue to generate random 1vs1 match-ups until you eventually exit out.   

**To Contribute toward this effort all I ask is that you spend a few minutes to open up each of the following polls and just vote on a handful of generated match-ups, helping create a more true consensus of /r/fantasyfootball**

The ranks allow people that are constantly asking ""start/sit"" questions between two players at the same position to garner the consensus opinion (in ranking form) of the entire sub, vs having maybe 1 to 2 people if that answer their roster decision on the daily index posts.

Sterling Shepard,"He’s got a great connection with Jones and has seen relatively consistent usage but hasn’t played with engram, Tate, and Barkley together in a game yet. Are the multiple concussions or more crowded receiving core valid concerns going forward?


If you own him are you holding/starting or trading/dropping for someone of similar value? Curious to hear other opinions.

Keeper league strategy for people missing the playoffs.,"Our league has a rule where last place gets the last pick the next year and 3 keepers are allowed from the 4th round to 16th round. Though it costs additional 5 bucks each to keep them,  and a 3 round penalty to keep them (so an 8th round pick, would be counted as a 5th round next year if decided to be kept. Waiver pick up keepers count as 9th rounders and go as 6th round keepers. 

Im sure some of you play in similar leagues.   For those projected to miss the playoffs,  would you be selling your studs (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th round picks) for a package of keepers.

Sam Darnold > Mono,"This is your alert to add Sam Darnold immediately if you are QB needy! Now we know Sam Darnold didn’t do so hot against the Bills (number 4 against QBs) in week 1. Yet, he still scored 13 in standard which I can’t complain about. 

This week Darnold beat the Cowboys (number 6 against QBs) and put up 338 yards and 2 TDs. I’ll definitely take that. 

Here’s his schedule the rest of the way and their rank against QBs according to CBS-

NE- 1

JAX- 17

**MIA- 32**

**NYG- 28**

**WSH- 26**

**OAK- 25**

**CIN- 28**

**MIA- 32**

BAL- 11

As you can see that Miami sandwich is quite special and very desirable if you need a QB like myself. The good news is Darnold is owned in 8% of ESPN leagues and is projected 11 this week against the Pats. Darnold had a lot of time for self reflection during his bout with mono and I believe that going forward nothing will be as hard as what he just went through as evidenced by upsetting the Cowboys. 

TL;DR
Pick up Darnold if you want a Top 10 QB from weeks 9-14 😊",69,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dii3ax/sam_darnold_mono/,1765.986602930228,r/fantasyfootball
Sleeper Trading Block,"I'm a part of a dynasty league that moved from Yahoo to Sleeper this year.

So using their APIs I built one - all you have to do is nickname your players 'OTB' and they will show up on the the trading block.

"Official: [Tuesday Waiver Wire] - Tue Evening, 10/15/2019","#Tuesday Waiver Wire Thread  

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it’s worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

Hidden Value? Patriots vs Slot WRs,"So the Pats D is obviously to be avoided and they’re a monster, but I like Jamison Crowder this week. Gilmore is playing like prime Revis on the outside, but even a great defense can’t stop *everything*, so that brings us to the slot. 

Of their 6 games, I’m not even counting Miami, the Falk led Jets, or the Colt McCoy led Skins.


Vs the 3 competent teams/QBs/slot WRs they’ve faced, here’s the slot production:

Vs Pit: Juju- 6 for 78

Vs Buf: Cole Beasley- 7 for 75

Vs NYG: Tate-6 for 102, TD

I think the Jets have momentum and will keep up with the Pats and make it a game, and the primary outlet will be Crowder. Fire him up",14,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dig33p/hidden_value_patriots_vs_slot_wrs/,1922.9699366172156,r/fantasyfootball

Hi Folks,

I've compiled FAAB bid recommendations from 10+ sites into a single spreadsheet that shows the *average bid*, *max bid*, and *number of mentions*.

**Relevant Info**

* The bid recommendation numbers are for % of total FAAB.
* Assumes a 1QB league.
* Players mentioned only once are hidden
* FAAB Recommendations for each site are hidden
* For sites that give a range, I recorded the average

**Comments and Requests**

I know it's already very late in the day, but I'm pulling these by hand after work. I'll try to get these out a bit earlier next week.

*If anyone has a suggestion for automating the process, please contact me*.

Good luck this week boys!

Do fantasy platforms make stat corrections to defenses?,"I lost my matchup by less than a point, and I was curious if stat corrections will change the stats of D/ST yardage based on the other stat corrections that are made.

Will the Broncos be playing keep away with Mahomes on Thursday night?,"Broncos are at home in primetime against a division rival. 

I see two scenarios:

1. Low scoring (40 pts O/U), low time of possession for Chiefs, heavy ground game for Denver. Travis Kelce should see an uptick in targets.

2. KC gets off to a hot start and Broncos abandon the run early. Flacco will look pedestrian as he struggles to get the ball to Courtland Sutton, ~~with Sanders potentially out~~ or Emmanuel Sanders. Chris Harris Jr. makes me nervous for Tyreek Hill in this one.",61,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/difbqh/will_the_broncos_be_playing_keep_away_with/,1978.2032700657844,r/fantasyfootball

Let's Stream Defenses: Week 7 (2019),"It's week 7, and we're official in bye week hell. We have 4 teams out this week, and after just two next week, we'll have four straight weeks of four or more teams on bye. The matchups line up in a way that there are really only seven teams I feel good about.

I've said recently that I think the Patriots are the only undroppable, start-them-every-week defense. This week, I've come to the conclusion that there's one more - the 49ers. Consider this:

* No team has scored more than 20 points against SF this year, and LAR was held to just 7.
* SF is tied with CAR for the 2nd-highest scoring fantasy DST so far, but they've already had their bye, so they did that with one fewer game than everyone else.
* By Football Outsiders' [DVOA](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2019), SF's defense is more than 40% better than average, second only to New England, but it's better than that. SF and NE are pretty close, and then there's a huge drop off between SF and the third best defense, Buffalo, who are only 13% better than average.
* This is SF's schedule: @WAS, CAR, @ARI, SEA, ARI, GB, @BAL, @NO, ATL, LAR, @SEA. With the way the Panthers, Packers and Rams have been playing on offense, the only matchups that really scare me are the Seahawks in week 10 (and 17) and the Saints in week 14.
* They're owned in just 25% of yahoo leagues, and get to face the tanking Washington Football Team this week.

Go pick up SF. They're a great start this week, and will be good all year.

Anyway, here are all the teams I rank as starters. If you don't see someone you like, that means I have them lower than 11th, and you can find them in my full rankings in my [article on FantasyPros](https://www.fantasypros.com/2019/10/lets-stream-defenses-week-7-2019-fantasy-football/). You can also find a little more depth on all of my starters there.

WEEK 7 BOLD PREDICTIONS & Week 6 Results,"Hey /ff - Nerds!
&nbsp;   

This was week 6. Jamaal Williams just outscored CMC in Standard, Stefon Diggs happened to break all of his owner`s hearts for a final time by posing the weeks WR1 by far once he was benched in about every league and let us not forget about the Cowboys who seem to be trending towards a new head coach in the near future. Will Tannehill turn the tides for Tennesse and will Matt Prater become the Pats D of Kickers?      

&nbsp;


What will happen in the next episode of *""Refs trigger Pat MacAfee so hard he has to rant for his entire show""*? Will the new and UNBEATEN Skins HC start the mircle SB run by running the ball every down (NFL Coaches hate this simple trick)? Make sure to tune in and give us your BOLDEST PREDICTIONS.

I have taken my time to check your predictions from last week and those are the winners:    

&nbsp;


**RIP predictions.**    

&nbsp;   

/u/cheela with the curse    

*""Dissly goes off for 121 yards and 2 TDs""*    
&nbsp;   

/u/HotBananaa with the meme. I guess we have to consider the Eagles to be a minor team now since Cousins actually did well. 

*""Cousins plays well in a big game.""*    
&nbsp;    

/u/NVRBLND commented on Tuesday. Everything went downhill from there

*""Gurley 3 tds. Silence from the doubters""*    

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
   


**The fantasy Jesus:**    

&nbsp;

/u/klancy05 has seen the future and warned you all. We better listen next time. Off by only 2 yards!!!  

*""Aaron Jones puts up a dud [...] 49 yards, a fumble, and 0 TDs""*     

&nbsp;    


   

**The not even close section:**    
&nbsp;


/u/Riican might have suffered a loss    

*""DJ Chark continues to ball and snags another pair of TDs on 5 catches for 90 yards""*    
&nbsp;


/u/YungFantasyBoi was let down by Fuller... just like he let those balls drop down on the ground    

*""WILL FULLER WILL HAVE ANOTHER 30+ POINT FANTASY WEEK.""*    
&nbsp;


/u/Bengalblaine still has faith. Fly, you fool    

*""Joe Mixon 20+ point game""*    
&nbsp;

   

**Honorable mention:**    
&nbsp;


/u/nicereiss was noticed

**Original Post for Reference:**

So what is this thing? I basically wanted to solve the mystery of “season average fantasy points per game”. With injuries and byes, you can never get a good look at the best fantasy players by total points, so I’m sure we all go and look at season average fantasy points per game to see who the best free agents are or to help decide sit/starts.

However I’m sure you’ve realized, there is an inherent problem when you do this. I always mentally called it “Desean Jackson Syndrome”. You’ve got two players you are comparing and they both are averaging 10 points a game through the first 3 weeks. However one of the guys scored 9, 10, & 11 and the other guy scored 1, 25, & 4 (Desean Jackson). The only way to know that this occurred is to click on each guy and look at the game logs, which is very annoying and time consuming.

Using pro-football-reference.com I was able to query the results of each player for each week and compile it all into one workbook. To make things simple and to match most of my leagues, I brought in fantasy points scored each week in a half-point PPR format. I then compared the points scored each week to the average in order to determine statistical dispersion, which basically is how far away do players stray from their average.

What you will find in the shared Google Drive PDF is the ability to determine the difference between consistent players or those that are boom-or-bust. You always hear, “that guy is reliable, he has a high floor” or “you can’t trust him, he’s boom-or-bust”, well now you can visually see those characteristics in the data.

Few things to keep in mind when you look at this:

* Fantasy points are shown with half-point PPR
* Anyone who hasn’t played in at least 50% of the weeks over any given period are filtered out
* Anyone who is averaging <5 fantasy points are filtered out
* This is simply a guide to help you analyze past performance of players and it does not provide game context or predict future performance

I hope you guys enjoy and thanks for all the advice over the years!",6,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dier1l/marzs_boomorbust_analysis_2019_week_6/,2018.1032701174418,r/fantasyfootball

In-Season Adjustment (Week 7 QB/RB/WR),"##Welcome back to the Week 7 edition of In-Season Adjustment. 


**What this is**: an attempt to predict the rest-of-season (ROS) value of players based on how they've performed given their matchups thus far and the difficulty of their remaining schedule (strength of schedule or SOS). I looked at the expected performance a player should have had given the matchups in Week 1-6 and applied that multiplier of over/under performance to the matchups they have in Weeks 7-16. 

&nbsp;

I’m consolidating this into one post since I’m posting image links now. New this week, I’ll be posting WR tables. 

&nbsp;

Obligatory note of caution: even though we’re now working with a 6 game sample, huge/bad games can still sway the results. When making trades, get a trade that reflects the current value of the players and you should be golden, assuming you’re getting the better schedules. When looking at the RB/WR, keep in mind that TDs heavily affect the future predictions. At this point, I would suggest using the WR table purely as an analysis of strength of schedule. 

&nbsp;

Let’s review the previous week’s recommendations. 


##Previous Week BUYs

**QB**

I said to buy Ryan, Winston, Murray, Minshew, Wilson, and to keep an eye on Darnold. Of these, only Minshew is looking like a misstep after a horrible game against the Saints. He dropped from #3 all the way to #17. New Orleans has looked much improved lately on defense so they may not be the easy matchup the early season indicated. 

Darnold is looking like a solid pickup. I haven’t ranked him due to sample size but his schedule is top tier other than this upcoming week versus New England. 

**RBs**

I said to buy Bell, Cook, Jacobs, and potentially SF RBs. No real change here as Bell and Cook are performing as expected according to their matchups, Jacobs was on a bye, and it’s still tough to tell how SF will shake out long term.

##Previous Week SELLs

**QB**

I said to sell Dak, Mayfield, Rodgers, and Wentz. Wentz and Dak were both big movers after last week (moving up to #10 and #11 from #20 and #19 respectively). I still think you should look elsewhere for a top tier QB due to their volatility in the rankings thus far and their remaining schedules. If you’re a playoff bound team, consider keeping Wentz, he has an amazing schedule. If you’re not, look to sell. 

**RB**

I said to sell Kamara, David Johnson, Mixon, and Zeke. All those are still looking good. Zeke moved up slightly and DJ moved up 9 spots but both are still outside the top 10 for ROS. Zeke, DJ, and Kamara continue to have brutal ROS schedules. 

##Previous Week HOLDs

**QB**

I said to hold Mahomes and Jackson with the caveat being you want to sell Mahomes before week 7 and optionally sell Jackson either before the bye (he gets NE in Week 9) or before week 13 (the playoffs). These are looking like correct calls as Jackson had a monster game (but was expected to) and Mahomes once again slightly underperformed his matchup. You can guess where I’m putting Mahomes this week.

**RB**

I said to hold Gurley and Fournette. Fournette moved up to #9 in ROS and still only has 1 TD to his name, he’s moving to the buy section. Gurley maintained his #10 position (remember this is for ROS and assumes he returns next week). 


##This Week BUYs

**QB**

* Ryan, Winston, Murray, Wilson, Darnold (all from previous weeks)

**RB**

* Bell, Cook, Jacobs, SF RBs (weaker confidence on SF RBs)

* Leonard Fournette: He has a dream matchup against the Bengals this week where we’re likely to see him at least double his TD count (because he only has, gasp, one TD so far). He has a middle tier schedule remaining, indicating that he’s likely to continue his performance with upside due to his low TD count thus far. 

**WR**

* Nothing here for now. The WR model isn’t very stable at this point and honestly a lot of the top WRs have good schedules, it’s easier to say who to sell based on tough schedules. Consult the table for good WRs with good schedules (there’s a bunch) for trade targets. 

##This Week SELLs

**QB**

* Dak, Mayfield, Rodgers, Wentz (from previous weeks)

* Patrick Mahomes: as mentioned in the previous week, Mahomes has the overall worst remaining schedule of any QB. Sell for name value while you can, there are a couple decent matchups left but zero top 10 matchups where he can really beat up on an easy defense. 

**RB**

* Kamara, David Johnson, Mixon, and Zeke (from previous weeks)

**WR**

It’s early with the WR model but I’d suggest selling tough schedules for a similar player with a good schedule:

* Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs: They have the 2nd toughest schedule remaining and 10 TDs between them. I’d bet that the Vikings passing game regresses. 

* Courtland Sutton: Another highly ranked WR with a bottom tier remaining schedule.

* If you’re struggling to make the playoffs: McLaurin, Jeffery, Shepard are players with difficult rest of season matchups but great playoff matchups. As a Scary Terry aficionado, I’ll be holding onto him as tightly as I can though.

##This Week HOLDs

**QB**

* Lamar Jackson (from previous week)

**RB**

* Gurley (from previous week)

* James Conner: the worse the QB is, the better he does. He has a decent schedule remaining and is worth holding just to see what happens. 

**WR**

* John Brown: An easy regular schedule suggests better performance is around the corner.

* Davante Adams: Depending on his injury, he has a middle tier regular season schedule and solid playoff matchups.

Week 7 Waiver Report - DFA,"#**Week 7 Waiver Report**


We’re highlighting players owned in less than 50% of leagues (NFL.com) that are quality waiver targets this week. We’ll suggest how much FAAB you should drop or how high of a waiver you should burn and give you our reasoning behind how we value each potential add. As always, keep in mind your individual league size and settings when making these decisions.


Check out the website for other content (link below) and keep an eye out for DFA’s Week 7 - Matchups Strategy Guide coming out Friday/Saturday. 


https://www.designatedforassessment.com/nfl/week-1-matchups-strategy-guide-part-2


#**Quarterbacks**


##**QB - Josh Allen - Buffalo Bills**


Allen may have been dropped in some leagues after being on bye in Week 6, but he absolutely needs to be scooped up where available. In his next 5 games, he plays the Redskins and Eagles and gets Miami twice. Allen is no Aaron Rodgers, but he is capable of putting up solid fantasy lines of 250-1 passing and 35-1 rushing. In these cushy upcoming matchups he could very well be ranked as a top-10 fantasy play multiple times due to the bye weeks. He’s worth dropping 5-10% of FAAB if you need a QB, and burning a waiver anywhere outside of the top-3. Consider him a must if you’ve dealt with injuries or poor play from your starting QB. 


##**QB - Kirk Cousins - Minnesota Vikings**


Play your QBs against the Eagles. Cousins certainly took advantage of a great matchup last week, but I think there’s a bit more to this. The Vikings know they need to be able to throw to beat the best teams in the NFL, and they have the weapons to do it anytime they want. Cousins isn’t going to throw for 300 and 2+ TDs every week, but who besides Patrick Mahomes is? His upcoming matchups aren’t perfect, but there are at least a few that will likely require the Vikings to throw (DET, KC, SEA), and his weekly floor is higher now that Thielen and Diggs have been re-incorporated into the offense. Cousins isn’t worth more than 3-5% of FAAB or a lower-end waiver priority, but he should be owned in most leagues at this point.


**RB Handcuff Stashes:** Chase Edmunds and Alexander Mattison - If you own David Johnson or Dalvin Cook you should already own these players. But if not, check their availability anyway as these players would be borderline RB1s if the starter got hurt, and could also make for trade bait later in the season.


#**Running Backs**


**Devin Singletary is 46.8% owned (NFL.com). #1 Priority if available**


##**RB - Jamaal Williams - Green Bay Packers**


Owners of Aaron Jones who thought he had finally been freed were likely floored by MNF’s timeshare between Williams and Jones. For those who have followed this situation closely it didn’t come as a major shock to see Williams get a piece of the pie, but how big it was and how quickly he got it were still a surprise. Williams isn’t going to be a workhorse back unless Aaron Jones were to get injured, but he could very well be in a 50% timeshare going forward. This role would keep him in the weekly flex conversation, especially in PPR leagues as it seems he is the preferred back in 2 minute drills and obvious pass situations. Don’t blow more than 3-5% of your FAAB dollars or a high waiver on Williams, but make sure he’s not available in your league. He could have standalone value ROS, and makes for an excellent Jones handcuff as well.


##**RB - Mark Walton - Miami Dolphins**


For those of you in leagues where the wire is completely dry, one name to keep an eye on is Mark Walton. After Kalen Ballage’s merciful demotion to third string, Walton become an almost equal part of a committee with Kenyan Drake. Walton received 11 touches to Drake’s 16, but actually turned them into 5 more yards (75 to 70). There’s almost no chance that Walton becomes a featured back unless Drake is traded or gets injured, but he can stake a claim to increased touches going forward based on his strong play. In an offense that will be playing catch up most weeks, his pass catching ability will be useful. Rosen and Fitzpatrick looked his way on check-downs quite a few times, and he made plays after the catch on almost every occasion. He’s worth a 3-5% FAAB bid and a low-end waiver in extremely deep leagues, and makes for a decent stash at the end of benches assuming there are no better options. For those in shallower leagues, keep an eye on him as he could be useful if given more snaps. You probably won't ever start him, but he's worth a look in deep leagues. 


##**Wide Receivers**



**John Brown is 42.1% available (NFL.com). #1 Priority if available**


**Robby Anderson is 46.5% owned (NFL.com). #2 Priority if available**


##**WR - Jamison Crowder - New York Jets**


A target monster in game 1, Crowder was a forgotten man in the sad days of Luke Falk’s reign as starting QB. Now back with his buddy Sam Darnold, both he and Robby Anderson look poised to make some noise. Anderson is the better add, but is likely owned in most leagues, but Crowder looks posed to be a great bye week filler, especially in PPR leagues. He has an obvious connection with Darnold on short routes and will see a solid share of targets every week. Consider a 5-8% FAAB bid depending on league depth and team needs at WR, and reap the rewards of a consistently solid 8-12 points in PPR formats.


##**WR - Auden Tate - Cincinnati Bengals**


Tate is criminally under-owned at this point, as he has proven to be a solid source of catches and yards when given the opportunity. AJ Green could be back any time in the next 2-3 weeks, but there really isn’t any reason for the Bengals or Green to rush things in a clearly lost season. The Bengals will need to throw every week as their defense is horrendous and they have no O-Line to create a running game, so Tate will see 8+ targets at least until Green returns. Tate is worth a 3% FAAB bid in any league that hasn’t caught up to his solid production yet, and could turn into a weekly WR2/3 if Green is dealt or shut down (very possible) later in the season. Don’t sleep on him.


#**Tight Ends**


**Hunter Henry is 47.7% owned (NFL.com). #1 Priority if available**


##**TE - Chris Herndon - New York Jets**


Noticing a theme here with these Jets players? Fantasy owners basically gave up on this entire offense when Darnold was out, and Herndon’s suspension meant he stayed under the radar even further. He also had a minor injury that forced him to miss Week 6, and is likely available in a lot of leagues. His production last year showed he can be a TE1, and Darnold likes what he has in the pass catching TE. Consider a 5-8% FAAB bid if you are in need of a TE. He could be a TE1 as soon as Week 7, and the scarcity of the position makes him a mildly high priority add.


##**Streaming Defenses Week 7**



**Buffalo Bills DEF vs. MIA**

                    
This one needs no explanation. If the Bills D was dropped during their bye week, consider bidding a few dollars to get them. For the same reasons that Josh Allen will be ranked highly the next few weeks (2 Matchups with MIA!!!) the Bills D will be in the top 5 of the DEF rankings multiple times over the next month. This is the rare case where a streaming defense is worth a few FAAB dollars for those that are flush.


**Jacksonville Jaguars DEF at CIN**

  
Although they have been mostly mediocre this season, Jacksonville still boasts a solid defense. If they can get Jalen Ramsey back, things will really take off, but regardless this is a week to stream them against a reeling Bengals squad. Even on the road, expect multiple turnovers and a few sacks from this group, and they are worth a 1-2% FAAB bid for those in desperate need of a Week 7 win.",6,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/did7kb/week_7_waiver_report_dfa/,2120.936603800456,r/fantasyfootball

"Do you trust Brandin Cooks in Atlanta this week, and vs the Bengals next week?","So Cooks hasn't exactly been living up to his hype. He was almost unanimously taken as the first Rams WR, but is very clearly behind Kupp and in some cases Woods. He's had 3/6 <40 yard games and a single TD all season. Granted, the game against the 49ers was low-production for all the receivers. But it's getting so hard to keep him in my lineup based on his name alone.

It's probably not his fault - he's obviously talented, but Goff is playing poorly, and dumpoffs to Kupp have become the go-to play. 

But after facing some pretty tough contenders (49ers, Hawks), they'll be playing the Falcons followed by the Bengals. Do you trust him in your lineup? If you're sitting him this week, are you ever going to roll him out again? 

No one who is informed is biting on a trade either. I've offered him for Scary Terry to an instant rejection. Even for Gallup, owner wasn't biting. 

Is anyone even slightly optimistic in Cooks for the remainder of the season? Especially in matchups that end up being extremely close?

Honestly, even if the Falcons matchup is juicy, I'm probably starting John Brown over him. Which I may regret if Cooks has a good game. But I'm at my wits end.",51,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dicxqi/do_you_trust_brandin_cooks_in_atlanta_this_week/,2138.8366038481395,r/fantasyfootball
Eagles DST Playoff Schedule,"Looking at the upcoming fantasy playoff schedules for teams, the Eagles have one of the easiest.
Their DST was dominant against the jets, but that was against a third string QB, and all other games (including against the Redskins) they have been subpar.

Or is the general consensus to prefer another DST like the Steelers or the Jets (both which seem to be on waivers in most leagues)

Derrick Henrys touchdown dependence,"Well it's finally happened guys, Henry had a bad fantasy game, so that means it's time for everyone who's been down on Henry to do some victory laps this morning. Time to bust out the I was right all along! If it weren't for touchdowns he'd be terrible! 

Now lets see how Henry would do if you start taking away those fluke touchdowns and allow all other running backs touchdowns. Henry is currently the RB10 in standard. If you take away 1 touchdown he drops to RB13. If you take away 2 touchdowns he's the RB15. If you take away 3 over half of his touchdowns he's still the RB15. If you take away all but one of his touchdowns he's the RB20. If you take away all of his flukedowns he's a measly RB24.

Seriously though, Henry was drafted in the 4th or 5th rounds as a RB2 with a high ceiling and a low floor. He's been better than what he was drafted as and really solid for his draft position. He'll still get touchdowns and those touchdowns will still count for his fantasy owners.

Comparable players who are half the cost.,"Trying to compile a list of names that people see similar to each other but are significantly cheaper. An example (could be way off base but here we go)

Tyler Boyd and Christian Kirk.
Because of injury Kirk should be available at a lesser rate than Boyd. Both have a high target share (knock on Boyd is his team) but maybe with Kirks injury the owner may sell at a discount.

James White and Chris Thompson

Let me start by saying I love James White in the pats offense. But with the committee in NE when Burkhead comes back May eat into the touches a slight bit. In come Chris Thompson, the redskins are awful and will play from behind a lot. Thompson May not light it up but can put up a decent number compared to White. Thompson could be had at a lesser cost than White IMO.

Trade Value Tuesday | Where's u/EfffTheSaints Edition," Didn't see this posted by my Tuesday lunchtime poo, so I thought I'd take it into my own hands... Please don't kill me.

A couple of important notes (READ THESE BEFORE POSTING, DON'T GET THIS THREAD LOCKED):This is NOT a thread to ask about trades for your specific team. Those belong in the trade thread in the stickied index posts. If we get questions like that the mods WILL lock this post and you'll ruin this for everyone.Make sure to CTRL+F your player's name to see if they've already been mentioned to avoid duplicate posts about any single player.

True value in your league is, obviously, dependent on the other owners in your league and the general trading climate. However, I think we can come together to get a better idea of where we generally stand on players.

If you have a player you want to test the level of value on, comment in this thread as a primary comment. Don't list your league settings, just the player's name. Other people then comment with their league settings and players that they currently own that they would be willing to give up in order to acquire the player listed in the primary comment. Try to list one-for-one deals as most experienced players know that 90% of the time two-for-one deals benefits the side getting the best player.

Let's use ridiculous examples just to show what this would look like:

Primary comment:

Antonio Brown

Child comment:

Dan Bailey, 9 team, 4.7 PPR

At that point, discussion under that child can include whether it's fair, too one-sided one way or the other and why.

Additionally, child comments can be packages, so if the player in question was Antonio, the response could be:

Dan Bailey and Raiders D/ST, as long as I'm getting a RB2 in the return with Antonio.

Here is a previous thread as an example to see how these should work.

To keep the thread clean, I'm requesting primary comments onlycontain the name of the player you'd like to see the value of.

CTRL-F your player's name to see if they've been asked about already.

You should be able to click ""show all \_\_\_ comments"" instead of the top 200. You can then CTRL+F your player's name and see any mention of them. Additionally, this would allow you to upvote your guy if he's currently buried to try to get him more visible and more likely to be answered.

This is NOT a thread to ask about trades for your specific team. Those belong in the trade thread in the stickied index posts. If we get questions like that the mods WILL lock this post and you'll ruin this for everyone.

I'll try to post this every Tuesday around 10 AM CST.

do NOT put your scoring settings in the parent comment, put only the player.

Bold Prediction: Jets vs Patriots,"I may be a little biased because Robby Anderson is my WR3 this week (sifting McLaurin against the 49ers), but this game is going to be a huge upset.

Think about it...divisional game, at home for the Jets, they just beat the Cowboys, and the Patriots are probably feeling a little over confident based on their schedule so far. Not to mention the fact that they demolished the Jets in week 3. Well I think this week is going to be a huge surprise for them. Darnold is healthy, Bell is hungry, Crowder is in the slot as Darnolds safety net, and Robby Anderson is a straight burner that has gone overlooked for far too long. This offense is completely different than what we have seen the first 6 weeks and I’m excited for them.

Not to mention the Patriots are struggling offensively which hasn’t yet to be fully exploited because of the teams they have faced. Remember the Patriots are not invincible and have their own unique struggles. If you have to I have no doubt about starting any of the Jets. It’s going to be a straight shootout!",49,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dibkli/bold_prediction_jets_vs_patriots/,2232.036604030927,r/fantasyfootball

A homers perspective on why should be wary of any receiving GB option that isn't Adams/MVS.,"(Gonna cross post from my other thread)

**Be cautious going after GB receivers not named Adams**

From a football aspect, the diversification in receiving targets is a breath of fresh air to have more than 1 or 2 players capable of getting the ball. But I've said from the beginning of the season, don't rely on anyone outside of Adams to be able to roster, MVS is a partial exception, he got hurt this game and didn't play the whole time.

Between Allison, Kumerow and now Lazard, I don't see them being good plays outside of flex plays in 14+ leagues. Lazard is going to be no different.

**GB receiving by targets:**

1. 7 targets, Geronimo Allison, 3/40/0
2. 7 targets, Aaron Jones (RB), 4/13/0
3. 5 targets, A. Lazard (WR), 4/65/1
4. 5 targets, J. Williams (RB), 4/32/1
5. 5 targets, J. Graham (TE), 2/17/0
6. 3 targets, J. Kumerow (WR), 2/17/0
7. 2 targets, M Lewis (TE), 2/50/0
8. 2 targets, MVS, 2/48/0

There's a full carousel in GB at RB, WR, and TE. I don't even like MVS that much, but he's definitely the next best thing if there's no one else to roster. Just don't be chasing fools gold with anyone else in Green Bay, not saying it can't happen with these players, just that there's absolutely no consistency with anyone with so many options.",40,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dibfgh/a_homers_perspective_on_why_should_be_wary_of_any/,2241.8199374000233,r/fantasyfootball

Will the loss of Tuitt significantly hurt their fantasy production? Or can we expect continued good performance from the unit as a whole?

"Official: [Tuesday Waiver Wire] - Tue Afternoon, 10/15/2019","#Tuesday Waiver Wire Thread  

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it’s worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

Defensive Ranks (Interactive overview of PPG per position vs. Defenses),"hey everyone, I made a website to show how many PPG fantasy players score against a certain Defense. If you click the team/value, you can view who has played the Defense at that position and the stats they put up

- The greener the color, the more points they give up. Red means stay away from that defense

- mobile users, sorry i'm too lazy to format properly (coming soon). The player stats look funky, but at least you can still see the player and the fantasy points they put up.

If you need help at WR, but can't afford to give up much, John Brown is the perfect target. This dude already has amazing chemistry with Josh Allen and is always a deep threat. Remember those bombs to Diggs this week against the Phi? Yeah, that'll be John Brown in 2 weeks.

Officials as Fantasy Players,"They've certainly had an oversized effect on the games, this year in particular.

It's not entirely a joke. All over the internet and on TV, you see people discussing the horrible officiating, the Monday Night game in particular. One thing you *don't* see, anywhere, is the names of the refs. The NFL will never release statistics about blown calls, bad calls, or calls that should be overturned.

However, it would be absolutely possible for fans to crowd source this information. There are enough football statistics geeks out there to provide a database of questionable calls matched to the official who made the questionable call. If this was presented as a ""joke"" player in Fantasy Football, and if this caught on, then we'd have a reasonable database of bad refs. As long as it's hidden, it continues.

The refs, this year especially, have a huge chip on their shoulder. Jason Garrett got flagged for spiking a challenge flag, but just before that, the referee flippantly mocked him saying (you can read the lips), ""If you don't like it, challenge it.""

Get the names, make them public, mock incompetence. That's how it gets changed.",9,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di8ln8/officials_as_fantasy_players/,2441.9532713015874,r/fantasyfootball

"Deep league WR sleeper for Week 7: Bills WR Duke Williams gets the Dolphins, coming off of 51 (78%) snaps in W5 with 4 targets, 4 catches, 29 yards and a TD","As week seven approaches, we've got a good amount of teams on bye along with a lot of WR injuries around the league. Fantasy teams are looking for some deeper WR plays on the wire for the upcoming week - I present you with Duke Williams.

Owned in only 0.6% of ESPN leagues and projected for 3.7 points, I'm sure he'll go unclaimed in the majority of leagues, but I think he's got upside for double digit points this week.

Williams got called up off the practice squad last week, and immediately stepped into a starting role - Week 5 snap counts ended up as John Brown (53), Williams (51), Cole Beasley (46). Zay Jones - who previously was working in the three WR sets - had one snap and was promptly traded to the Raiders after the game.

He seemed to show good rapport with Josh Allen, getting four targets, catching all four for 29 yards including a nifty TD: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?edufilter=NULL&v=zI9rKC475AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?edufilter=NULL&v=zI9rKC475AM) Full transparency, I'm not sure any of these show anything special, but he seemed to be a good option for Allen in that \~10 yards downfield space between Beasley short and John Brown deep.

Williams isn't out of nowhere - he was a stud WR at Auburn (War Eagle, the main reason I recognized him) but was suspended multiple times and eventually kicked off the team after a bar fight. After going undrafted, he was signed by the Rams but says his heart wasn’t in football his first time around in the NFL and washed out of the league.

He went to the CFL in 2017, and led the CFL in receiving in 2018 with 88 catches for 1579 yards and 11 TD (!). The Bills signed him in the preseason where he became a quick fan favorite and got a lot of preseason run.

The Bills face off with the Dolphins this week, who have given up at least 30+ points to opposing WRs in PPR in every game this year. John Brown is the no brainer play this week with massive upside, but I think there's more than enough  points in this game for Williams and Cole Beasley to eat too, and like Williams' shot at getting in the end zone. I think he makes for a shot in the dark flex or WR3 in deeper leagues and an interesting stash in dynasty leagues. He's 6'3, 225 and definitely a physical presence that the Bills lack with Brown (5'11, 178) and Beasley (5'8, 174).

\* Robert Foster has missed the entire season with a toe issue so far, so theoretically if he comes back and practices/plays this week, I probably wouldn't be comfortable starting Williams this weekend, and it renders this wall o' text somewhat moot",40,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di8klm/deep_league_wr_sleeper_for_week_7_bills_wr_duke/,2444.169937984149,r/fantasyfootball

Best Unowned Team - Week 6 2019,"This is the best lineup using players owned in 5% of leagues or less according to Yahoo. I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules. 

POS - PLAYER, TEAM - OWNED% - SCORE

* **QB - Ryan Fitzpatrick - MIA** - 1% - 9.78

* **RB - Brandon Bolden - NE** - 1% - 11.5

* **RB - Dare Ogunbowale - TB** - 1% - 10

* **WR -  Jaron Brown - SEA** - 0% - 16.4

* **WR - Allen Lazard - GB** - 0% - 14.5

* **TE - Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE** - 3% - 12.2

* **FLEX - Cameron Brate - TB - TE** - 1% - 11.7

* **D/ST - New York Giants** - 1% - 12

* **K - Brandon McManus - DEN** - 5% - 13

This team totalled 13% owned and would've scored 111.08 points.

Ryan Fitzpatrick rejoins the best unowned team for the first time since Week 1 last year when he had 42.28 points. What a great week that was. I assume MIA will roll with Rosen, if they stay with Fitzmagic they may accidentally win a game.

Brandon ""James Develin"" Bolden filled in nicely as the NE TD vulture. Ogunbowale finally did something since having some quiet hype as a sleeper in the preseason. And by did something I mean he lucked into the endzone.

Jaron Brown makes his yearly appearance on the list. The highest scorer among the best unowned team this week but with only 5 targets I don't think he will be a trusted fantasy asset anytime soon. I doubt he becomes the main beneficiary of Dissly's vacated targets.

Allen Lazard! I've enjoyed watching him since he was in college. I was happy to hear he was getting a shot but I never expected him to become a Green Bay hero (full disclosure, I am a Packers fan and fully acknowledge that the Refs are really the reason we won that game but that was still some clutch play by Lazard). I doubt he is rising up the depth chart from this though. Once Adams, MVS, and Allison are healthy all at the same time, if that is possible, they are the GB passing attack. 

RSJ is back as the best unowned TE. Njoku will probably take his role back when he gets healthy but it is nice to see that the TE in Cleveland does have a significant role, at least in the redzone. It's never a great scoring week for the best unowned team when we're flexing a TE and this is the lowest scoring week on the year. OJ Howard truthers probably love to see Cameron Brate here though. I think we have enough evidence to suggest the Jameis Winston just prefers Brate but even that is too inconsistent to trust week in and week out. 

The Giants being the top defense in a week where they played the Patriots is certainly a surprise. The Jets scored well against them, too, a few weeks ago. Stream New York Defenses against New England? Eh, probably not.

Slim pickings this week. Bye week hell is tough on the best unowned team because of higher ownership of sleepers and fewer players in the pool.

# Week 6 Accuracy

~~Last week was an example of a decent, average accuracy week from my model.  I had 2nd best accuracy for the week, with only Zuerlein as a major outlier.~~

\^  This was my drafted text, from last night.  Things looked good!  It turns out my accuracy took a major hit, with Prater's 21-point MNF performance against my prediction of 3 points.  It's a little awkward: My rankings still would have guided you to the 2nd most points, among ranking sources last week (by a weighted average of the 16 top-ranked kickers), but my chosen accuracy measurement is based on a correlation coefficient, which punishes missed kicker boom games if they are ranked in the bottom.  Gotta keep true to the evaluation, and this is what it looks like:

In the chart, I have also indicated how my rankings would look if Prater were simply deleted from the data.  I think it's interesting, mathematically, how 1 error can have a large impact.

# Week 6 Accuracy

[Last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dezo5v/defensive_maneuvers_week_6_dst_rankings/) was a good time to switch to making this a ""consensus"" post, as my own model lags slightly behind Vegas-implied D/ST ranking.  I'll analyze some other time.  The main faults were being too high on Falcons while being too low on Panthers and 49ers.  Sources like theScore were better at evaluating those teams.

(Week 7 DST Rankings),"***Seasonal Strategies (Mid to Late Season)***

We've now arrived at phase 2 of the fantasy season and that means two things in regards to DST streaming. 1) We now have a better idea of how good perspective offenses and defenses are. We now know approximately what DSTs to hold, which DSTs are streamable and who to stream against. 2) We also know more about positional players. That means a likely decrease in waiver wire fodder. Generally, if a waiver claim candidate emerges at this stage of the year it's because of injury. As a result holding two DSTs become more feasible. Knowing your league goes a long way here. Are you the only DST streamer? You can probably get away with jumping from streamer to streamer on a weekly basis. Are there multiple people in your league streaming? You might have to look ahead. 

Only two DSTs stand out as obvious holds right now (San Francisco and New England, predictably.) Chicago is a likely hold, as long as Trubisky doesn't tank them. Apart from that the strategy seems to be stacking up as many Dolphins opponents as possible. Streamers may want to look ahead to week 8 and grab the Steelers.

With Sam Darnold and Case Keenum back under center the Jets and Redskins aren't quite as juicy of matchups. You can certainly stream against them in many cases, but don't count on them being Dolphins-esque (ie. don't commit as many resources into streaming against them.) In addition, the Cardinals, Bengals and Giants are strong candidates to stream against. Outside of them it's week to week territory.

That's really it. DST strategy gets a lot simpler form here on out. If you have a hold candidate, hold them. If not, gauge your league and plan ahead accordingly. 

&nbsp;

***Bye Week Advice***

Byes: Browns, Buccaneers, Panthers, Steelers

Apart from the Browns, all of these DSTs have exceeded expectations. Nonetheless, it's hard to vault any of them into hold territory. To reiterate though, the Steelers are worth a hold for their week 8 home matchup with the 'Phins.

***Stream of the Week***

Giants (vs Cardinals)

Last week saw the DC's team as my weekly streamer, that required some holding of the nose. You might just wanna turn off your sense of smell this week. I don't have much confidence in the team in blue who mistakenly refers to itself as New York. The idea here is that Kyler Murray will be throwing a lot, which means opportunity for something to go wrong. This is a terrible week for streaming though.

Chargers RB situation,"It was a fantastic run but i think it is over. Last 2 games with Melvin Gordon back, Ekeler had 8 carries for  21 yards. He is not a good rusher  so he won't be the main back. With only catches, he is a glorified James White / Tarik Cohen ros.

Melvin Gordon is not doing much better himself. He is getting carries but doing nothing with them. He got 20 carries for 49 yards. He also got 3 receptions last week for 30 yards which could be manageable but :

1. Justin Jackson was out last 2 weeks.  And he ran pretty well before that, so he will probably get some carries moving forward
2. They are against Ten and then Chicago and GB

[Unpopular Opinion] Leagues with 6+ Playoff Spots need a Wilcard Spot,"It's clear from many past posts and comments here you are all fantasy purists. The goal every week is to score 0.02 more than your opponent, that's it, get the W. However my thinking is your goal should be to finish with the most points in the league every week. With every week 1-13 being equal, so you don't sacrifice week 10 to get a couple more points in week 6. 

That being said, I'm a novice by r/Fanyasyfootball standards, having only played FF for 10 years now and only in 2 leagues at a time. However the system is broken. Every year we have someone in the bottom 2 of points for, make the playoffs because of an incredibly easy schedule, and someone in the top 3 of scoring miss the playoffs. This year we are taking it to the extreme in one of my leagues. 7th place is 2-4. 3 of the losses have been while scoring the 2nd highest week in the league. With 688 standard scoring points for and 760 against. To put that into perspective, There is 1 other team with 600 points for, and league average 563 (including the 688.) No team have more than 601 points against. It's early there is still a chance for this team to make the playoffs if they keep putting up these numbers, but there is no guarantee. meanwhile first place Has 560 points for and 501 against.

&#x200B;

How do you fix this, say you have 6 playoff spots, follow the league standings for playoff spots 1-5, spot 6 goes to the team with the most points scored that finished below 5. 

Yahoo (don't know other platforms) allows the commissioner to edit the playoff seeding and to edit the standings week to week. The latter is helpful in a league like Mike Wright plays in. Every week you can earn 2 points. 1 for beating your opponent, 1 for finishing in the top half in terms of points for.

Noah Fant,"After losing Dissly and getting beat to Henry last week i wanted to organize my thoughts on a potential replacement TE: Noah Fant. 


**Pros**
- Matchup: KC’s defense is not very good. Espn has them as the 27th ranked OPRK (32 is easiest). Fells/Atkins put up ~100 yds last week

- Talent: dude’s fast but definitely raw

- has been pretty consistently playing at least 66% of snaps



**Cons** 
- Rookie TE

- Broncos Passing Volume: Flacco has thrown for under 200 yds the past two weeks. Partly due to the defense showing up. 

- no more than 5 in a game (19 on the season)

- 1 RZ target (he scored once from outside the RZ I believe)


**Conclusions** 


-He’s obviously not a sexy pickup by any means but he could be set up for success this week against a poor KC defense. If you’re as desperate as I am in a league that doesn’t trade he may be worth a look this week. Worth monitoring Sanders status as well. 


-If I’ve missed anything or am off please let me know, I’m only looking at box scores because i haven’t watched any broncos games. I’m also desperate so I’m probably reaching.

"Official: [Tuesday Waiver Wire] - Tue Morning, 10/15/2019","#Tuesday Waiver Wire Thread  

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it’s worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

Is Damien Williams startable?,"In the four games he played he had disappointing 63 yards rushing on 32 carries (2.0 avg), 116 yards receiving yards on 13 receptions and 2 TDs. Last week was close to a complete dud if he didnt got this TD on one of his two touches. Now with a short week comming for KC you have to decide early, if you want to play him. (i guess he is at most flexable?) With some other players questionable (or their roles are questionable) for the sunday games, how do you feel about him? Will he bounce back? Will KC bounce back? Their run game the last two games was close to non existent. What players are you playing over him? i still think he has the upside to go of for 100+ scrimmage yards + 2 tds in this normally high powered offense, but is it really reasonable to take that gamble after that many bad performances?",24,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di5vx9/is_damien_williams_startable/,2682.2699384490647,r/fantasyfootball

"Pierre Desir, the Nuk Killer","Pierre Desir is a cornerback on the Indianapolis Colts. Probably a lesser known player around the league. He's 6'1"" with 33 inch arms and plays with good physicality and length.

Here are his 3 matchups when he was a starter vs Hopkins:

- 2019 Playoffs: Hopkins had 10 targets and 5 receptions for 37 yards and 0 TDs. Check out their [matchup here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOH_xdBVAs).

- 2018 Week 14: Hopkins had 10 targets and 4 receptions for 36 yards and 1 TD.

- 2017 Week 9: Hopkins had 16 targets for 6 receptions for 86 yards and 1 TD.

Note, I did leave out their other 2018 Week 4 matchup where Hopkins went for 169	yards and 1 TD but Desir was actually a [backup](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/colts-pierre-desir-listed-as-backup-on-depth-chart/) for the first quarter of the 2018 season.

The Colts have held Hopkins to under 40 yards each of their last 2 matchups. I do believe they have found their Hopkins solution by having Pierre Desir counter Hopkins physical style of play with his own.

Usually you start your studs but Hopkins isn't a stud (*angry downvotes*) so I personally don't think it'd be out of the question to bench him this week.",41,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di54w0/pierre_desir_the_nuk_killer/,2762.0866051514945,r/fantasyfootball

Jamaal Williams is the bane of A. Jones' existance,"Jamaal Williams will not go away, and he negatively affects A. Jones more than any backup RB affects a starting RB in the league.  Why?  

A Jones is an unstoppsble force when given Bell Cow treatment.  Based on how dominant the Packers were against Dallaa without Jamaal Williams, I wonder why the Packers use him so much?  

I know Aaron Jones had a rough start against Detroit... but it seemed as if he was punished",73,0.24,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di3zug/jamaal_williams_is_the_bane_of_a_jones_existance/,2890.6199385325112,r/fantasyfootball
What defense are you targeting for the playoffs?,"In other words, unless you have the patriots defense, are there any defenses that you’re targeting on the wire or on another team that has a fairly good matchup schedule in weeks 14-16?

Edit: 

So far some good recommendations are:

Steelers (arizona - Buffalo - New York Jets) I’m not sure about the Arizona matchup because their offense isn’t fully developed yet in my opinion and could see much improvement throughout the next few weeks.

Jets (Miami- Baltimore- Pittsburgh) as u/randypandycottoncndy mentioned, the jets defense gets better soon with Mosley making a return this week or next, and so does their offense with Sam darnold making a return soon as well. Im scared of Lamar Jackson though, so wouldn’t start week 15 more than likely. 

Packers (Washington- Chicago- Minnesota) This one is interesting because they’ve already played Minnesota and Chicago and scored 9 and 13 fantasy points respectively, and the fact that they also play the redskins is a cherry on top. 

I’ll update as more suggestions are commented down below, but I just found a defense that plays Miami and Washington in weeks 14-16: The giants. They also play philly which may or may not be a startable option that week, but for the record they’ve already played Washington before this season and scored 24 points by my leagues scoring format (3 PA, 4 ints, 1 TD). Something to consider.",116,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di2u6j/what_defense_are_you_targeting_for_the_playoffs/,3014.8032718658446,r/fantasyfootball
Chiefs Backfield,"My favorite part of FF this year is the enigma which is (still?) the number one offense in the league’s running backs.

We would think it would be set and forget with that side of the ball you could flex their water boy but alas we have no real grasp of how this rbbc is going to pan out.

It’s official kc o-line is pure trash.

Is Damien Williams able to achieve his adp?
Is Shady still even worth a flex?
Is Darrell Williams still a handcuff?
Is Darwin Thompson a victim of random process and natural selection? 

Are any of you panick selling or holding? Starting with confidence this Thursday ?
Or sending them to the bench ?",72,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di2jko/chiefs_backfield/,3043.7532719333967,r/fantasyfootball
Why don't people respect Darren Fells?," People seem to not realize a few things.

#1 Texans changed offensive coordinators this year.  Their new offensive coordinator?  Tim Kelly was their TEs coach the last 2 years.  You don't think that has something to do with the Texans featuring Fells?


#2 Fells at age 33 had a late start at football and is still developing his skillset.  At 6'7"" he is an obvious redzone threat.


#3 Fells' snap count hit 87% this week and has basically risen every week. He has outsnapped Jordan Akins every week but week 1. They ran nearly identical number of routes this week.


#4 Deshaun Watson has had significantly more time to throw this year so he is no longer chucking the ball to Hopkins.  He is throwing to who is open which is often Fells.


#5 Texans base offense runs two TEs and even when Kenny Stills returns Fells will be on the field quite a bit because he is their best blocking TE.



If you need a TE, Fells should be at the top of your list.",45,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di2ij5/why_dont_people_respect_darren_fells/,3046.48660526673,r/fantasyfootball
Interesting Draft Concept (Rotation Draft),"I thought I would share this draft concept that I’ve used a few times before. It’s called Rotation Draft.

Team A is on the clock first, but they do not take a player. Instead, Team A selects an NFL team. Let’s say they pick the Jaguars.

Team B is on the clock, and they can do one of two things. Primarily, they can select a player on the Jaguars. Let’s say they pick Leonard Fournette.

Team C is up, and they decide to take Dede Westbrook.

Team D is up, but they don’t like any of the available players. Team D elects to do the second option, ROTATE! Team D selects a new team and does not pick a player. Let’s say they pick the Eagles.

Team E selects Alshon Jeffery.

This process of picking teams and players repeats until every team has a full roster. Draft order is not snaked. Once a team has a full roster they can only rotate teams. Once every team has been cycled through they can be reused. It pays off to wait for the best players late, but you don’t want to miss on early studs. Try to stick to bad teams early. I thought someone might find this draft concept interesting.",61,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di2gpz/interesting_draft_concept_rotation_draft/,3051.403271949291,r/fantasyfootball

"Keenan Allen owners. Besides any ironic commentary on his late season wardrobe changes, what makes you confident on him bouncing back to a WR1 status","I always see people on this sub talk to Keenan Allen’s previous late season success and dismiss any idea of him maintaining this low production.  With the Chargers offense looking like stale cornbread and the (not so)recent addition of other offensive threats to take targets, I don’t see any upside for the ROS.

Last year Allen started off very slow, but then put together a good 6 game stretch where he averaged around 15 points. But then dropped off the face of the earth for the last three games.  The season before that had a similar script. Although he had a much better front end of the season, he still dropped off mid season only to come back to 4 games averaging 19 points. But yet again was completely absent at the end of the season when we needed him in the playoffs.

I would just like to know what’s keeping all you Allen owners (like myself) from not losing faith?",163,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di0r50/keenan_allen_owners_besides_any_ironic_commentary/,3198.419938762983,r/fantasyfootball

Examining the Team: San Francisco 49ers,"Hello! In this series (where I hopefully go through each team), I want to review the season up to this point and review each of the offenses to see which fantasy players you should either A) hold, B) sell high, C) buy low and in what leagues they have value. I'll begin the San Francisco 49ers, my favorite team and the one I know the best.


**Disclaimer: I'm offering suggestions, but the main point of this post is to open up discussion.**


**QB: Jimmy Garappolo**

Everyone's favorite pornstar-banging QB, there have been major concerns about Jimmy G's productivity. Through Week 6, he's thrown 113 passes for 921 yards (230.2 y/g) and 7 TDs. The common consensus is that he's played perfectly average and been able to succeed thanks to his supporting cast. There's certainly some truth to those views. Take the 49ers' victory over the Steelers: Jimmy G threw some awful interceptions that could have been exploited for points by better offenses (sorry Mason Rudolph). And even in the Rams win, he had a brain-dead pick at the goal-line where threw it nowhere near the intended target. Also, considering that the 49ers are 31st in the league in pass plays per game (due to heavy ground game emphasis), Garappolo appears to be more of a game manager than a gunslinger.

However, I'd also like to make it clear that Jimmy G has been able to perform even with an inefficient run game. In the team's win over the Rams, the 49ers only had 99 rushing yards, with most coming in the 4th quarter when they were trying to burn through the clock. Instead, when Coleman and Breida were being bottled up early, Shanahan relied on Garappolo to throw short-yardage passes to convert third-downs and move the ball down the field. If anything the interception in the red-zone was the anomaly of the afternoon, as the QB was able to spread the ball effectively across the field.

**Conclusion:** Even with the positives, due to the low volume and TD opportunity, Jimmy G is at best a bye-week fill-in. He'll have some nice games in the future with the Redskins next week and the Cardinals down the line for streamer fantasy owners; unfortunately, the priority will always be establishing the run game over. **Hold** if you have him because you're only holding on to him for depth, or as an option in 2-QB formats. There's zero trade value to be had. However, Jimmy G is extremely important for...

&nbsp;

**WRs: Dante Pettis, Marquise Goodwin, Kendrick Bourne, Richie James, Jr., Deebo Samuel**

Look, I know how little value the 49ers place on their WRs. If anything, they are used to either A) stretch the field, B) pre-snap motion to confuse defenses or C) short-yardage pickups. There's a reason to hope, though. While James and Bourne have little fantasy value in any league and Goodwin only has value in the lens that Travis Benjamin has value in LA (deep-league flier that explodes every one or two games), Pettis and Samuel should be on your benches in 12-team formats.


Samuel's the easier of the two receivers to dissect. Even though he had a bit of an injury scare in the Rams game, through the season, Samuel has had the highest snap count out of all the WRs. This isn't likely to change because Samuel's build makes him a perfect blocker for screen passes and a solid target in the red-zone. In games that are close throughout (barring one, most games this season have been blowouts), Deebo Samuel will have relied on more and more. Think of him as the safest option here (albeit, not a sexy one).


I want to talk up Dante Pettis, however. While the sophomore wideout clearly was not trusted throughout the season for his training camp failures, through the last few games, his usage has skyrocketed. On Sunday, he had the most targets in the game out of the WRs (six), and from what I'm seeing, he has A) the most separation out of everyone, including TE George Kittle (1.83 y/c vs. 1.5 y/c) and B) has clearly regained Shanahan's trust. I'd never say you should buy into a 3 for 45 yard-line, but honestly, if you need bench depth, Pettis is a decent option. He, at the moment, appears to be back on track as the team's WR1.


Trent Taylor and Jalen Hurd will be returning soon, though. While Hurd is a WR/TE hybrid that should be used in schemes akin to Juice (as a blocker with receiving potential), Taylor should slide into the starting slot position. He had the training camp of his life this offseason and could command a solid target share, but this more hypothetical and he shouldn't be on any rosters.


**Conclusion:** There are no great options here, to be honest. Pettis has the ""star-potential"" but he's been wildly inconsistent in snap count share. Samuel is the best performing receiver, but could easily turn in dud performances any week. **Hold** Pettis and Samuel, if you have them: their trade value is non-existent, but until the 49ers are truly tested, we don't know which WR will be relied on (if George Kittle doesn't just hog everything).

&nbsp;

**RBs: Matt Breida, Tevin Coleman, Raheem Mostert, Jeff Wilson, Jr.**

The bread and butter of the 49ers offense has and always will be their ground game. Regardless of the team they face, Shanahan will rely heavily on the 49ers run game to either tire the defense or pick up chunk yardage. There's certainly a reason why: Coleman and Breida are both effective RBs. But who's got command of the backfield.

From what I've watched, Coleman is definitely the more heavily used back. Thanks to his pass-blocking, he'll see third-down usage and see the more prominent usage in the passing game (he dropped a would-be TD pass that was a bit off target on Sunday). However, the more explosive and efficient runner is Matt Breida. If you told me that one of the RBs had busted off a 20+ yard carry and asked me to guess who it was, I'd say Matt Breida 10/10 times. Breida is less effective in short-yardage situations and in the red-zone, so his TD potential is low, but due to how often the 49ers run the ball, there's certainly value to be had.

However, I do want to raise some red flags, though. While it's easy to jump on the Booger McFarland hate train, the 49ers did struggle to establish the run game on Sunday afternoon, mainly due to the absence of key blocking weapons (McGlinchey, Staley, Juice). This isn't a death knell for the running game (Shanahan's scheme and play design are otherworldly), but that isn't to say that fantasy owners should sit idly either or remain unconcerned. The 49ers are solid in pass protection but were unable to create holes for the ground game, and with games against Carolina, Seahawks, Bears, and Vikings on the horizon, it's fair to say that there may be weeks where the 49er RBs bust.

Oh and Raheem Mostert has no fantasy value, by the way, unless either RB ahead of him gets injured. He's the garbage time back who's on the roster for special teams work. However, if Breida or Coleman fall, Mostert should be a high priority add.

**Conclusion:** This may be a hot take, but I believe there's room to be concerned about the rushing attack. They'll get their volume, but without key blocking pieces and as teams slowly adjust to the scheme and sell out to stop the run game, I'm concerned the production won't be there or will be split. This isn't a reaction to one game, I want to be clear, but I think you'll be able to extract more value in a trade than you might get later down the season. **Sell high on Breida and Coleman,** as both are low-end RB2s that can be packaged for a higher-tier RB, like Mack, Freeman, or Montgomery.

&nbsp;

**TE: George Kittle, Levine Toilolo, Ross Dwelley**

George Kittle is good at football. He can catch, block, run routes, stretch the field, and heck he might be able to throw the ball for all I know. If you have him, it's unlikely you have better options right now, so you're probably holding him. However, the only reason I mention his two teammates Toilolo and Dwelley is that both saw above 30 snaps on Sunday. Why? Because while most people were concerned that Kittle's role in the passing game would reduce with him having to take over more blocking duties, instead Shanahan as turned to two TE sets where either Toilolo or Dwelley become the main blocker, effectively a bandage solution while Juice is out. Obviously, neither is good as the Pro-Bowl FB, but it's definitely a good sign for Kittle's volume and consistency.

**Conclusion:** Kittle's consistency will remain. He should be held unless you get a mindblowing offer, but as TE is starting to head into the wasteland territory with injuries, you're probably not selling.

&nbsp;

**K: Robbie Gould** 

Anyone freaking out about Robbie Gould should relax. The main long snapper will be returning from his suspension soon and this is the first time the P Mitch Winsoky has ever been a holder. They'll build chemistry over time and Gould will remain a top kicking option due to the amount of offense the 49ers should be able to generate + the good field position the team starts with thanks to their defense.

&nbsp;

**DST**

The Saleh-led defense is for real. Not only are they able to generate consistent pressure on the QB, just rushing 4 (behind only the Patriots), their secondary has actually been impressive (which is extremely surprising as a 49ers fan as we haven't made many changes from last year there). Besides the Patriots and maybe the Bills, they are a DST you should hold, regardless of matchup, thanks to the sacks + turnovers they will generate.",39,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/di06km/examining_the_team_san_francisco_49ers/,3246.953272132079,r/fantasyfootball

Barkley 8-10

Gurley 5-16

Kamara 16-62

Cmc 22-31

Really amazing how well they've stopped lead Rbs.

After the bye they see:

Henry, Carson, Dj, Kamara, Freeman, fournette, mack, kerryon and Hyde.

I think Hyde and Freeman are easy sits. But other than those two, the rest are set and forget guys typically.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years?

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

Statistically (in)Significant: Week 6,"Welcome to Statistically (in)Significant, the place to find great stats that probably only matter at the water cooler (or bar). Each week I'll dig through the stats of the week gone by and deliver you some choice conversation starters. All fantasy stats are standard Yahoo scoring, unless otherwise noted.

&nbsp;

**5 TE’s at the Top**

&nbsp;

Through Sunday in Week 6, the tight end spot in fantasy has been quite a slog. There’s been no dominant player at the position, though there have been a few pleasant surprises. Going into this week, there were 5 players between 49 and 51 points on the season. Unfortunately, it looks like **Will Dissly**, who led the pack by a very slim margin, could be done for the season with an Achilles tear. That leaves us with the newest break-out TE **Austin Hooper** as our leader. Hooper took advantage of a Cardinals defense that is giving up an absurd amount points to opposing TEs. Hooper has now finished as a top 3 TE in 3 of 6 weeks so far this season. Rounding out the top 5 are the always reliable **Travis Kelce, Evan Engram** (who missed a game, so his per-game average is still pretty good), and finally the Ravens break-out star, **Mark Andrews**. 

&nbsp;

**78 Passing Yards**

&nbsp;

**Jared Goff** had a whopping 78 passing yards on Sunday, a career low for him, which roughly equates to $20,833 per yard gained through the air this week. The Rams had a particularly bad game against the still undefeated 49ers. They scored a TD on their opening drive and then did nothing for the rest of the game. The fact that they gained all their yards on the ground that first drive seems like a bad omen for the way the rest of the game went for them. It’s hard to tell where this team’s fantasy potential is headed. On one hand, this offense was a juggernaut last season and now have scored at least 27 points in 4 of 6 games this season. On the other hand, you have **Jared Goff**, who has thrown more picks than touchdowns in the last 4 weeks. Aside from this week, the Rams are still putting up decent fantasy points with their big players, so I wouldn’t ditch them all yet, but I would consider who I start against the 49ers going forward.

&nbsp;

**116 Passing Yards in One Drive**

&nbsp;

The Chiefs haven’t done a lot of winning the last couple weeks, but **Patrick Mahomes** is still doing amazing things on the field. In their first drive, thanks to several penalties, Mahomes managed the stunning mathematical trick of throwing for 116 yards in one drive. Unfortunately for the Chiefs, they only gained another 157 yards through the air the remainder of the game. They only had about 20 minutes in time of possession for the entire game, and clearly this has become the (rather obvious) method for defeating the Chiefs. Last week, they had just under 23 minutes in time of possession. Against the Texans, the Chiefs only ran the ball 11 times despite never being down more than 7 points in the game. On the other side, the Texans ran the ball 41 times to go along with 42 passing attempts. Balance, my friends, is key in all things.

&nbsp;

**27 D/ST Fantasy Points**

&nbsp;

With another 27 fantasy points this week, the **New England Patriots D/ST** squad has just dominated fantasy football. Their 27 points made them the 8th highest scoring “player” in Week 6. On the season, the defense and special teams have combined for 5 TDs and have 16 turnovers in just 6 games. They’re second in the league with 25 sacks and have given up only 3 touchdowns on defense all season. Their 127 fantasy points on the season make them the 9th highest scoring entity in fantasy football this season, behind only one non-QB, **Christian McCaffrey**. Compared to other D/STs, they are 52 points ahead of the second highest scoring team and have more than doubled up the 4th highest scoring team.

&nbsp;

**36.5 Fantasy Points in Week 6**

&nbsp;

The squeaky wheel does often get the grease, though sometimes it takes a few weeks to apply it. This week, **Stefon Diggs** had a monster game, scoring 3 TDs and 167 yards on 7 receptions, adding 18 rushing yards on 2 carries just for fun. This more than doubles his season total in points – he had just 27.3 through 5 games going into Week 6. Since the Vikings rough defeat in Chicago Week 4, they have put up 66 points in just two games. During that time, **Kirk Cousins** has 2 300+ yard games to go along with 6 TDs and just one pick. It turns out that the Vikings can’t just run the ball all game, like they did early in the season. They need to pass it as well, thus giving their offense balance. Déjà vu, no?

49ers DST FAAB spend question?,"49ers DST is currently only owned in 64% of Yahoo leagues and 53% of ESPN leagues. 


If they are sitting on your waivers how much FAAB would you drop for the #2 DST in the league which is already past their bye.

Going by that rule is it fair to spend 15-20 bucks on them or are people willing to spend more in their leagues?",22,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhy9sm/49ers_dst_faab_spend_question/,3395.236605767409,r/fantasyfootball

Anyone else losing confidence in Travis Kelce?,"Before anyone says “shut up ur lucky u have him”, u gotta realize the draft capital it took to get him.

Anyways, does anyone else feel like Kelce is trending down as the top fantasy TE this year? There’s something different about the KC offense this season bc he’s not getting any TDs and his targets are lower than expected. His floor has been fine but we haven’t really had any blow up games yet, which is concerning. I feel like his usage is at an all time low, with only 8 catches over the last 2 weeks. We know what he’s capable of, as he proved week 2 and in previous seasons, but his production seems a bit lackluster when u take his ADP into consideration. As someone who is supposed to be a target hog and score a lot of TDs, I really don’t think he’s living up to his draft position thus far when there have been multiple stud TEs coming off the waivers.",80,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhwr5z/anyone_else_losing_confidence_in_travis_kelce/,3500.9866059501965,r/fantasyfootball

[Advice] In a close game should you sit your remaining player(s) if you are barely winning but your opponent is tapped?,"This question came to mind as I find myself in a strange situation.

"FIRE UP THOSE, UH -- NEW YORK GIANTS???","One of the keys to winning fantasy football is to realize how quickly things change in the NFL. Right now the Chiefs, Rams, and Cowboys look somewhat broken. Would anyone have suggested that a few weeks ago?

I just have this inkling that people may be overlooking the Giants as a potential source of fantasy gold going forward. Of course the general consensus is that the G-men are mostly crap, outside of Barkley. But consider this:

Daniel Jones has seemed to breath new life into the Giants, but they just came off the worst team to play, and haven't had everyone healthy at the same time all year.

Now, or in just a few weeks, they're going to have Jones, Barkley, Shephard, Tate, Engram, and the quietly emerging Darius Slayton as offensive pieces to pair with a mediocre at best defense that may lead to shootouts. I think this team will be a somewhat surprising source of points in the 2nd half of the season.

Chase Edmonds vs David Johnson,"After watching yesterday’s game, does anyone else think Chase Edmonds just looks like a more explosive running back than DJ these days? I owned DJ last year during the horrible McCoy days, and I thought Edmonds generally looked better then too. Obviously DJ is still producing and is a great pass catching back with good vision, but in terms of hitting the hole, evading/breaking tackles, and lateral movement/speed, Edmonds has just looked better to me. 

This isn’t suggesting that Edmonds should take the starting job or anything, but I’m just wondering if I’m crazy in thinking that he’s looked better. In the first half yesterday, it seemed like they were splitting the backfield pretty evenly, but they leaned more heavily on DJ after the half.

Any Le'Veon Bell owners worried about his fantasy performance now that Darnold is back?,"When Darnold was out, Bell was practically (if not literally) the leading receiver on the team in terms of targets. Falk did plenty of check down passes and screens as Bell was his comfort blanket/quilt.

But did anyone see how many targets he got against the Cowboys? Just 1. Now this is mainly more an issue for PPR leagues but Darnold being back means there's a bittersweet and/or double edged sword feeling for Bell.

The positives is now Defenses can't key in on Bell anymore or else Darnold can use his other weapons (R. Anderson, J. Crowder, D. Thomas). Thus we'll probably see an uptick in his run game regardless of the O-Line issues. And because the offense can now move through the air, I see Bell getting plenty of dives into the endzone.

The negatives, again in PPR, means this will be a significant downgrade in recent performances. Less reliance on Bell in the passing game because now the Jets have their QB back, and he's not afraid to throw it deep.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

Titans Receivers With Tannehill,"Anyone have any takes on if there is any good speculative value for Corey Davis , AJ Brown, or Adam Humphries? It looks like with Tannehill under center, they are going to be throwing a bit more. Target volume for all three receivers almost doubled compared to when Mariota is throwing the ball this past week. I'm looking at Humphries in particular as the underneath slot guy in a PPR league. He was pretty decent when he was on the Bucs and if Tannehill continues to start, I think he can end up being a consistent WR 4, borderline 3. Corey Davis has the biggest boom/bust potential though imo with AJ brown in that conversation.

Maybe i'm reading too much into this and should stay clear of the dumpster fire that is the Titans but I tend to try and look where others aren't.",43,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhsce0/titans_receivers_with_tannehill/,3801.7366067330045,r/fantasyfootball

If you have someone playing tonight or on bye. Consider dropping them for the bills dst or Josh Allen,"As far as I know this only works if you’re league utilizes free agency. 

The bills are playing Miami next week, so this could be a good time to get ahead of your waivers. Luckily for me, my opponent has no more players to play and I only had the GB dst remaining. I typically stream QB so I dropped the dst for Josh Allen.

Take a look at who’s available from any of the teams that haven’t played, maybe they’re worth an pre-waiver add. Maybe you’re going to be targeting them during waivers. This gives you a guarantee that you’ll get them and you might still be able to get another player during waivers.

Texans TEs? A discussion,"Looks like, with Hopkins struggling (ailing?) this year, Watson has been spreading the ball around more, including to his TEs.  Currently Jordan Akins and Darren Fells are in an almost 50/50 split; Akins is a more athletic rookie, while Fells is a career journeyman.  However, Fells also has the edge in production as of late.  

Texans have some great TE matchups coming up so I think they’re names worth considering if you’ve been hit by injury (IE with Dissly).  Either has TE1 potential if the other goes down, but injury’s not really something you’d want to bet on.  Which of the two would you prefer RoS?  Can both be startable at the same time?

* Week 9: Home for San Francisco

* Week 10: @ Tampa Bay

* Week 11: @ San Francisco

* Week 12: Bye

Obviously @TB is a very playable matchup. However, given what we've seen out of Goff and Baker the last two weeks I'd strongly prefer to avoid playing him against SF.

Is Zac Taylor really the offensive genius we thought he was?,"Let's take a deep look at Zac Taylor's coaching timeline:

* After flaming out of the NFL and CFL, Taylor was looking for work
* He **began his coaching career under his father-in-law Mike Sherman** at Texas A&M in 2008
   * In his time from 2008-2011, Sherman served as a a Graduate Assistant and Tight Ends coach
* Mike Sherman was fired from Texas A&M in 2011 but was hired as the Offensive Coordinator for the Miami Dolphins for the 2012 season 
   * It seems a bit weird that Mike Sherman was hired as an OC when he was fired from a college team after a super disappointing 4 years at A&M. Let's see how that happened:
      * Philbin is named head coach
      * Philbin hired Sherman to be his OC
      * Previously, Sherman gave Philbin his first job in the NFL when Sherman was the Head Coach/GM of the Packers - So it seems that Philbin was returning the favor
      * Sherman was happy to have his son-in-law tag along 
      * *Yes, Nepotism is a common theme here*
* Obviously, Taylor was now in need of work so again he followed his father-in-law and join the Miami Dolphins as an Assistant QB Coach
   * Taylor was promoted to QB Coach in 2013 
* Mike Sherman left the Dolphins to coach high school football in 2014 and Bill Lazor was hired
* In 2015, Bill Lazor is fired and our boy Zac Taylor is named Interim Offensive Coordinator
   * **As OC, points decrease 17%, yards decrease 8%, and touchdowns decrease 24%**
   * Yes, this is the same Bill Lazor that Zac Taylor replaced in Cincinnati  (Lazor was the playcaller when he was fired)
   * **Taylor's success in Miami was ""developing Ryan Tannehill""** (developing him to what?)
*  Dolphins decided to part ways with Taylor and Taylor was hired as OC for Cincinnati after Jim Turner put in a good word to Tommy Tuberville (Cincinnati's head coach)
   * **In his 1 season at Cincinnati, Taylor's offense failed to score a TD in 3 games**
   * **His team went 4-8**
* Taylor was hired as assistant QB coach in 2017 and promoted to QB coach in 2018
   * Taylor studied under McVay but never was the playcaller
* In 2019 he was named Head Coach of the Bengals 
   * **Bengals are 0-6**
   * **Rank 29th in points per game**
   * **Rank 32nd in rushing yards per game**

There's a long history of a lack of success in Taylor's coaching past. Let's see some excuses we can make for Taylor to make us feel better:

* He inherited Marvin Lewis's team
* He doesn't have AJ Green
* His offensive line sucks

While these may be valid, I'm staying away from his offense this year and I'm definitely not drafting any Bengals next year.",137,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhqrh8/is_zac_taylor_really_the_offensive_genius_we/,3919.2366069515547,r/fantasyfootball

Charting your own league,"Hey FF fam,

I started to create basic charts for our league showing total points scored, and points against.

Basically it's just for checking who actually performs well or who is getting crushed by bad fortune.

It has lead to some seriously funny smack talk so I wanted to think of some other charts that would be interesting.

One idea would be the 'golden hand': counting the points left on the bench vs. the ones in the starting lineup. The issue with this is that I can't find them accumulated somewhere (platform is ESPN).

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Sometimes you need a miracle!**

Whether that means you hold on to your narrow margin of victory to squeak out a win or you overcome a big deficit in points to avoid defeat, this is where you can talk about it.

This thread is focused on how your match has gone so far and what you need to happen or to avoid happening in order to get a win. If you're posting team specifics and looking for feedback, please be sure to post complete rosters of both teams as well as your scoring settings and current scores for the teams.  It's recommended to use a formatted table if possible, and usually preferable to specify which team you are.  Links to screenshots of your matchup are welcome

The Case for the Steelers D/ST,"Right now the Pittsburgh Steelers defence is 27% owned in Yahoo leagues, a criminally low number imo.

I know after our 0-3 start everyone was ready to write us off. But, with the acquisition of Minkah (and Bush), our defence has been TRANSFORMED. Here are some pretty significant defensive stats on our season before and after Minkah.

*Before Minkah:*

* 30.5 PPG
* 445 YPG
* 320 Pass YPG
* 2 Takeaways

*After Minkah:*

* 17.7 PPG
* 296 YPG
* 169.7 Pass YPG
* 10 Takeaways

&#x200B;

Our defence does not only revolve around Minkah. We have **10** first-round draft picks playing on our defence at the moment, some Pro Bowl and All-Pro worthy. Here are some more critical stats about our D this season:

* **3rd** in Sacks (behind only CAR & NE)
* **3rd** in INTs (behind again NE & CAR)

These turnovers mean our defence still puts up pretty decent scores even when teams score highly against us:

* Week 2 (vs SEA: 28 points) - 7 fantasy points
* Week 3 (@ SF: 24 points) - 11 fantasy points
* Week 5 (vs BAL: 26 points) - 11 fantasy points
* Week 6 (@ LAC: 17 points) - 14 fantasy points

&#x200B;

Our schedule is ridiculously nice from Week 8 onwards with a few tough fixtures sprinkled in. I am planning on rotating the Bills D with the Steelers until Week 12 from which I will set-and-forget this Steelers D.

* Week 8 - Miami
* Week 9 - Indianapolis (Bills play Washington)
* Week 10 - LAR (Bills play Cleveland)
* Week 11 - Cleveland (Bills play Miami)
* Week 12 - Cincinnati
* Week 13 - Cleveland
* Week 14 - Arizona
* Week 15 - Buffalo
* Week 16 - New York Jets

&#x200B;

I know this may seem crazy to some but come Week 16, I believe we will still be in playoff contention and fighting as hard as possible. Our losses (bar the Patriots) have been a 2 point loss, a last-minute TD to lose, and an overtime loss. Our record does not reflect our team and with the schedule we have coming up, and with the weaker division we are in, I truly believe we will be playing for something come the end of the season.

&#x200B;

One concern I have had is the struggles of our offence. Our offensive struggles meant that our defence was on the field for most of the game. However, with Mason Rudolph coming back, James Conner looking good, and our offensive line being one of the best in the league, I hope things will be changing. Especially with that schedule, I don't see our offensive struggles continuing much further.",43,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhoc4u/the_case_for_the_steelers_dst/,4154.869940567017,r/fantasyfootball
How we feeling with Melvin Gordon?,"Obviously two games is a tiny sample size, but since I only got 55 points this week I've decided to press the panic button. And since he doesn't have the easiest schedule from now on, what's the game plan? Is he a ride or die or is it good to sell?",83,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dho9h0/how_we_feeling_with_melvin_gordon/,4163.836607233683,r/fantasyfootball
Is Brandon Cooks droppable through Bye weeks?,"Rams have looked poor recently and Cooks seems to be 3rd in line behind Kupp and Woods. O-Line aren’t giving Goff time to go deep, so targets aren’t there.

Are these temporary O-Line issues or likely season long? Right now I’m more likely to drop him to get me through bye weeks than Fitz/Alshon.

Edit: I understand the responses saying this is kneejerk and I normally wouldn’t consider. I have TE bye (Hooper) and QB bye (Baker) who I don’t want to drop, so I’m having to consider dropping someone I don’t want to. No one is interested in trading for Cooks and want to play to the situation not the name, hence questioning whether this O-Line is significantly worse than previous years. Cooks isn’t getting the targets he previously has.

Edit edit: 12 team 2 QB league, hence value of QB with the Duck and Rosen the best of the rest available.",44,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhngpw/is_brandon_cooks_droppable_through_bye_weeks/,4262.569940582911,r/fantasyfootball

The Story Behind Hopkins,"After Hopkins started the off the season opener against the Saints on MNF, people who drafted Hopkins in the first rounds creamed their pants myself included based on his performance. As the weeks went on Hopkins didn't perform up to par based on his draft ADP sending his owners in a frenzy. Let's break down the timeline of Hopkins, starting from last season.

Hopkins tore his shoulder ligament ""completely off the bones"" during the 2018 playoffs. 

Source: [https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/1783583](https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/1783583)

Then coming into this year he sustained a rib injury after game 1.

Source: [https://www.rotoballer.com/player-news/deandre-hopkins-limited-with-ribs-injury/669449](https://www.rotoballer.com/player-news/deandre-hopkins-limited-with-ribs-injury/669449)

Up to this point Hopkins was already working  his way back to 100 percent for the start of the season, and suffering  a rib injury in Week 2 threw a wrench to the beginning of his season.

Despite his injury early this season, he still hasn’t missed a game and has 31 receptions, 347 receiving yards, and a pair of touchdown catches through five games. His production isn’t actually poor, but it is a slight regression from Hopkins’ production in 2018. Hopkins started last season with 39 receptions, 594 receiving yards, and two touchdown receptions in the first five games in 2018.

I believe that a combination of playing banged up and defensive game plans tailored to contain Hopkins are playing a role in his lack of production. However, with the improved personnel on offense, the defenses will have to be honest and won’t only be game-planning to stop Hopkins as the season progresses.",64,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhlkoq/the_story_behind_hopkins/,4472.619940686226,r/fantasyfootball

Hunter Henry? How's every feeling after what you saw tonight.,Dude came right back into the mix with LAC essentially what we all thought he was being drafted as.

"Do you ever pull a player if you’re barely winning, and your opponent doesn’t have anyone else left to play?","I’m currently up by .1 points, with one player left to play on Monday.

What to do with anyone on the Bengals offense?,"I drafted Boyd and mixon. Not the greatest move but it is what it is now. Boyd snagged me 26 points last week and 1.6 today. Nixon has at least met projection last week but struggles just in general with the Bengals o line. Trades? Of course. Drop one? I'm contemplating it. Curious what others have done here. 

Boyd is tough to get rid of just from a target standpoint. Had 10 today even. Didn't grab enough but that's bound to happen with a 0-5 offense.

Thoughts on Denver DST,"Saw they put up a respectable stat line against the Chargers week 5, and they absolutely killed it today. Any Denver fans (or anyone who caught the games) can explain what’s going on with this Defense?",29,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhip7k/thoughts_on_denver_dst/,4738.1699409842495,r/fantasyfootball
Tevin Coleman moving forward,"It’s time to consider Tevin Coleman as a top 15 back. He’s is the primary ball carrier in Kyle Shanahan’s run offense, the 49ers game script will tend to favor Coleman’s play, and he is top red zone back. As the season progresses I also expect his involvement in the passing game to increase just like it did this weekend. Breida does get his touches but when Coleman first came back last week he had 16 touches and had 20 this week, in a Kyle Shanahan offense... I expect him to get on average 15-20 touches a week with a slight uptick in the number of catches he gets. That’s a pretty nice floor, even with the other RBs involved. Although I think his ceiling is lower than other top backs, his high floor makes him a steady week to week RB2 and fringe RB1 when the matchup is juicy.",171,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhio2g/tevin_coleman_moving_forward/,4741.269940984249,r/fantasyfootball

Worth holding the 49ers rest of the season?,"I was skeptical at first holding the SF defense through the rest of the season since they didn’t play any high powered offenses but watching the game today, I became more confident in rolling with them although I’m still on the fence since they only played a better opponent once.

From what I’ve watched, they did a great job of shutting down Goff and the entire offense as well. They seem to be a good consistent source of sacks and although the INT’s might be lacking, they apply great pressure to the offense. 

Their bye week is done but they play some tougher opponents like GB, Seattle (twice), and NO when Brees is set to return. Would they still be worth rostering if you want to roll with a defense for the rest of the season?",94,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhimnl/worth_holding_the_49ers_rest_of_the_season/,4745.169941000144,r/fantasyfootball

"Consider again starting Kirk Cousins Weeks 7, 8 and 9","Kirk Cousins is guranteed to finish no lower than 9th in total points during the last two weeks. As of now the only QBs to score more in weeks 5 and 6 are DeShaun Watson, Matt Ryan, Kyler Murray and Russel Wilson. Aaron Rogers, Matt Stafford and Phillip Rivers could surpass him points but all would need good to great games.         
Cousins upcoming schedule is against Detroit, Washington and Kansas City. All three teams are allowing above average points to Qbs this year.     
Currently, he is owned in approximately 25% of all leagues. If your Qb is hurt and or on bye during weeks 7, 8 and 9 consider start Kirk Cousins.",64,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhii4h/consider_again_starting_kirk_cousins_weeks_7_8/,4756.586607702573,r/fantasyfootball
Which players have a very safe floor but no upside past that?,"Who are guys in the league that don’t offer any upside outside like 6-8 points a week? Before this week Boyd seemed like a great safe floor player with not a huge upside.

Deedee Westbrook seems like a very consistent player with not a huge upside. Steady targets but unless he busts out for a touchdown he’ll get around 50-70 yards receiving.

Any other candidates who are consistent point getters but outside of a career day are gonna score 6-8 points?",165,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhighq/which_players_have_a_very_safe_floor_but_no/,4760.653274385134,r/fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

Would you roster Carolina’s DST through their bye?,"You’ve seen these posts before. The comments are: “It depends on your bench, your byes, etc.”

But, last 4 weeks:

13, 14, 14 and 21 points.

Bigger question: How healthy will they be after the bye and how good are they really? 

Are they sack machines or have they just played bad lines? 

They are currently 4th overall, but points separating the next tier isn’t a lot.

But if you count weeks 3-6, it’s been wild.",29,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhhdm9/would_you_roster_carolinas_dst_through_their_bye/,4853.953274552027,r/fantasyfootball

Brandin Cooks coverage this week,"Cooks vs SF

Anyone know how Cooks CB matchup will likely look this week? Seems like a good week to bench him for dang near anyone with that niners front 7 pressuring goff. 

He’s not a dumpoff target and he’s not likely to get a ton of time to develop long routes. Hard to see more than 5 point in hppr without a TD. If he’s got a decent CB matchup he may be able to overcome this though..",40,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhcxt0/brandin_cooks_coverage_this_week/,5183.619941532612,r/fantasyfootball

Davante Parker?,"Yes we all know what a tanking disaster the Miami Dolphins are. however they happen to have an excellent matchup this week. Additionally if one looks at are yards both Preston Williams and DeVante Parker or among the NFL leaders. Of course they haven't done anywhere near enough with them.

Do you think this could be a sneaky start? He used to be considered a prototypical x receiver with speed and big size frame. Josh Rosen at quarterback perhaps offer some things that were not there with Fitzpatrick and there's a good chance that Albert Wilson is out this week.

Thoughts on DeVante Parker this week? Does he have any Flex appeal rest of season?",21,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dhck3m/davante_parker/,5213.103274917603,r/fantasyfootball

"Top PPR RB/WR/TE once TDs are removed, sorted by PPG","Yesterday, u/AlanTheCow asked if there was any resource ranking players in PPR, without TDs. In response to that, I looked up the respective lists for the top RB, WR, and TE (which you can view [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgygp9/comment/f3gdbpu) ).

u/whosurcaddie then asked if it was possible to format the lists into PPG, so that is what I present to you here. A few notes though:

- All figures are taken from nfl.com fantasy
- All figures are accurate as of Saturday night, meaning TNF has been accounted for, but not the ongoing UK game
- Unless specified, every player has played 5 games
- Players currently injured ARE listed, but current free agents like AB are not
- RB and WR each have a 50 player list, whilst TE have a 20 player list, to reflect supply and demand

Heads up for Tyler boyd owners,Marlon Humphrey has been shadowing the opposing teams #1 wr this year. So Boyd isn’t necessarily safe just cause he plays mostly from the slot.

for tonight he might be worth a start? If you think about it, he is only one injury away to start at QB and get QB production in. 


And because the Steelers are injury-cursed at QB this season there is a way for him to get enough snaps to be relevant fantasy-wise. So if you are really tight at WR this weekend, why not take a small gamble.

Can SF D/ST duplicate last week's performance/ sack count ?,"SF D/ST completely hammered the browns , Nick bosa subsequently got DPOW and SF D/ST is kinda trending in terms of starting a good D/ST against the Rams tomorrow .But wondering if their performance last week is due to the fact that ugh, TE Demetrius Harris was tasked with blocking Bosa? Not sure if Harris blocks more than runs routes, but seems to me that this probably won't happen if a OL is protecting rather than Harris the TE.

Is Demarcus Robinson being overlooked this week?,"Pros:

1. With Watkins most likely out it looks like he would slide right into his role. 


2. He has had 90+% snaps for the last 4 weeks so he is on the field all the time on a high power offense. 

3. He has the 3rd highest targets only behind Sammy and Kelce. 


4. He has been with team for 3 years now and has a good understanding of the scheme and worked with Mahomes longer. 


5. He leads the KC WR with airyards, aDOT and was on the [week 5 airyards Leaders by Opportunity Delta](https://old.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dghwwd/buy_low_with_air_yards_week_5/). As a Curtis ""Airyard Champion"" Samuel owner I understand that airyards dont translate to fantasy points but the QB situation should be weighed in but in this case I feel good about Mahomes and them connecting more than any other QB throwing the ball. 


6. This going to be a very high scoring game with Vegas line set at 55. 

Cons:


1. The KC passing situation is truly unpredictable and anyone can be the flavor of the week. More murkiness is added if Tyreek Hill plays and it is trending that way. I still feel Demarcus Robinson will be out there for his usual 90+% snaps. 

2. KC O line is missing 2 offensive starters and texans have a good pass rush, so Mahomes will be pressured a lot this game. 



To wrap it up I am sure he there is some uncertainty but I still feel he is ranked too low for someone catching balls from Mahomes and most likely being part of a shootout.",50,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dh3mm9/is_demarcus_robinson_being_overlooked_this_week/,6133.836609085401,r/fantasyfootball

Against the grain football fantasy opinions you had before the season and how they turned out.,"One of the best ways to get better at fantasy is to revisit past stances you had and critically evaluate them. Where and why were you right and vice verse for when you were wrong? I’ll start with 2 of my own I posted here. 

-Take:
Zeke’s holdout situation is pretty much as bad Melvin Gordon’s, so why is he going so much higher in drafts.

-Thread response 
Chargers are cheaper than the cowboys and zeke is more important to cowboys than Gordan is for the chargers.

-Result
Zeke signed an extension and played on week 1. Gordan did not sign an extension and first played week 5.

-My current take
So chat was right here and I was wrong. Most of my logic here came from the fact that I felt it was smarter for the cowboys not to sign zeke since zeke has next no leverage and pollard was likely be a good fill in. I still feel this is case (especially with what happened with Gordan, and because zeke isn’t even the focal point of Dallas’s offense anymore), but fantasy football is game about predicating what teams will do and not what everyone thinks they should do. In this case Zeke is a player that Dallas makes a lot of $$$ off of (sells jerseys and the tickets), and Jones isn’t exactly known for making the smartest decision. 

A current situation that kinda of mirrors is the Duke Johnson, Carlos Hyde backfield. Many people continue to start Johnson because they feel it makes more sense for Johnson to get more touches, but there’s been no indication that the team feels this way. 


-Take 
Russell Wilson is being drafted too low around the 10th, because while his efficiency may drop some from last year his volume should go up (Seattle won’t run the ball on 52% of snaps)

-Thread response 
Brian  schottenheimer and Pete Carroll call the plays now. Seattle will continue to be a run first offense and Russell’s efficiency will go down. He’s being drafted where he should.

-Result
Depending on site scoring Wilson is ranking from 2nd-4th in fantasy points among QB’s.  Seattle is passing the ball slightly more than 52% of the time. Wilson is running the ball himself at a much higher rate than in 2018

-My current take
I was right and wrong here. I knew there was a chance Wilson starts running the ball himself more this year, but it was something I was really banking on. Passing plays in general are up for Seattle, but not by a huge amount. Really I was most right when liking Wilson because he was good and not because he was going to get more volume this year.

The key thing to remember here is that unlike every other position, efficiency is more important for a QB than volume.  I and pretty much everyone else ob here where wrong in just assuming that Russ’s efficiency had to go down. Turns out he’s that good. 

Oh well I’ll just have to cry into the cash I’m likely to win from the all the different leagues I got him late in.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Don’t look now, but San Francisco is 4-0 for the first time since 1990 (ESPN). As an avid SF fan, I'd like to believe this team is for real, but the fact that they haven’t faced a team with a winning record can’t be ignored. The teams they’ve faced so far are a combined 5-15… The Rams are going to be their first legitimate test and the winner is in the driver's seat to win the NFC West. **Jimmy Garoppolo** hasn’t been spectacular from a fantasy standpoint and isn’t an option in 1QB leagues, but he’s been solid, posting the 14th best QBR. He really hasn’t been asked to do much as SF has ran away with most of their games. While rookie **Deebo Samuel** posted some good fantasy lines this season, there really is no clear No. 1 receiver for SF, 5 wideouts are consistently seeing snaps. At this point, all of the SF wideouts should be avoided due to the unpredictability of where volume will be going any given week. Samuel is at best an upside WR4/5. **Marquise Goodwin** is the second best bet to produce, while **Dante Pettis** belongs on the wire. **George Kittle** has graded out as the best player in the league (PFF) through 5 weeks and is an absolute stud. He did pick up a groin injury on Friday, and is now questionable for Sunday, so monitor his status before kickoff. Assuming health, he’s locked and loaded as a TE1 every week.    


**RB Breakdown**


The San Francisco running game seems to have narrowed down to the two man race originally pictured when the team signed **Tevin Coleman** in the offseason. **Matt Breida (upgrade PPR)** put up the big line last week, but Coleman saw the most carries in his return from injury. **Raheem Mostert** was involved as well, but only saw 7 carries in a game SF ran an eye-popping 40 times. **Jeff Wilson** was inactive last week, but could be used as the FB this week, replacing injured FB Klye Juszcczyk (Ninersnation). He’s not a fantasy option. Interestingly, LAR is ranked in the top-10 for Run DVOA, but is bottom-10 in FPPG to running backs at 21.5. The matchup is exploitable for the SF backs and both can be considered RB2 options in a game carrying the 3rd highest projected point total.   


**Rams**


**Opp (SF) Pass DVOA:** #1


**Opp (SF) Run DVOA:** #5


**Injuries to Watch DEF (SF):** CB Ahkello Witherspoon (OUT) DE Dee Ford (Q, on track to play)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (LAR):** Todd Gurley (Q) WR Brandin Cooks (Q)


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Cooper Kupp (28%) Robert Woods (21%) Brandin Cooks (15%) Gerald Everett (12%) Todd Gurley (10%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Todd Gurley (96%, 18, 5) Malcolm Brown (4%, 1, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


**Jared Goff’s (downgrade)** new contract is starting to become a hot topic around the NFL due to his poor play and the four-years and 134 million dollars remaining. It’s safe to wonder if he’s the long term answer or if the Rams shot themselves in the foot by getting ahead of themselves with the new contract. He’s currently the QB15 through 5 weeks, and a QB2 this week against possibly the best pass-rush in the NFL (11.3 FPPG to opposing quarterbacks). Probably the only bigger fantasy/real life disappointment this year is Baker Mayfield. **Brandin Cooks** has managed to pass through the concussion protocol well in advance of Sunday's game, so he joins **Cooper Kupp**, **Robert Woods** and **Gerald Everett** as Goff’s main targets. Kupp has continued a reign he started last year before tearing his ACL, and he needs to be considered a matchup proof WR1 moving forward, getting 9+ targets every week of the season. Woods is a solid WR2 and a threat to break a few big plays every week. Everett has put together impressive back-to-back weeks, and was putting up solid numbers even before Cooks went out last week. He’s a back-end TE1 against a defense only allowing 3.2 FPPG to tight ends. That number is extremely skewed due to the teams they’ve faced, but temper expectations with Everett. Cooks himself is a WR2/3 that may have a lower ceiling this year due to the O-Line issues, but consistently piles up targets and yardage every week. 


**RB Breakdown**


**Todd Gurley** is out Sunday with a quad injury, and if you saw our waiver article earlier in the week, it was highly recommended that Gurley owners scoop **Malcolm Brown** while they could. With Gurley likely out, Brown becomes a plug and play volume based RB2 in a tough matchup. The 49ers have only given up an amazing 9 FPPG to running backs so far. However, they really haven’t faced a competent offense yet. Rookie **Darrell Henderson (stash)** should be added but not started to see how things play out. There’s a chance his role could grow in the absence of Gurley, especially in the passing game - he caught 63 passes in 3 years at Memphis (Ramwire). If he sees meaningful minutes this week, he could be considered as a flex option next week in a smash spot for the Rams offense against ATL.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Devonta Freeman (53%, 16, 5) Ito Smith (47%, 11, 6)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Atlanta’s defense the last few years has been abysmal, in 2017 they finished 22nd in Football Outsiders’ DVOA efficiency measure. In 2018, they were 31st (SBnation). Dan Quinn was heralded as a defensive guru, but clearly something is very wrong with whatever the Falcons are doing on that side of the ball. On the other side, the offense has struggled almost as badly this year. Week 6 offers a smash spot for the Falcons to get back on track. **Matt Ryan (upgrade)** offers top-5 upside at quarterback, Arizona is giving up 23.2 FPPG to the position, 4th worst in the NFL. In the second highest projected point total of Week 6, all of the Falcons pass catchers are in play this week as well. **Julio Jones (upgrade)** has been limited through the week but is fully expected to play. Without CB Patrick Peterson (serving the last game of his six game suspension) Jones should be heavily involved and is a good bet to finish as the overall WR1 this week. **Calvin Ridley (upgrade)** has been disappointing the past few weeks, but Arizona’s terrible secondary offers a smash spot for the talent sophomore receiver. Hopefully his target share becomes more consistent as the season moves on, he’s been #4 in the pecking order thus far. **Mohamed Sanu (upgrade)** is also in play this week as a WR3/4 for bye-week needy owners. **Austin Hooper** is a top-3 tight end option against an Arizona team that cannot guard the position, hemorrhaging 16.4 FPPG. The Cardinals linebackers are all sorts of banged up as well, offering even more upside for Hooper.  


**RB Breakdown**


**Devonta Freeman (upgrade)** and **Ito Smith** have split snaps evenly all year, capping Freemans upside. Atlanta’s struggles on offense haven’t helped either, Freeman has seen just 2 carries inside the opponents 10 yard line this year. The Cards run defense isn’t anything to write home about, and this is a great spot for him to breakout of his funk - consider him an RB2 with added upside in PPR leagues due to his consistent pass game usage.

**Opp (ATL) Pass DVOA:** #30


**Opp (ATL) Run DVOA:** #7


**Injuries to Watch DEF (ATL):** CB Desmond Trufant (OUT) CB Blidi Wreh-Wilson (Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (ARI):** WR Christian Kirk (Q, trending toward playing) WR Damiere Byrd (Q) RB David Johnson (Q, GTD)


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Larry Fitzgerald (22%) Christian Kirk (22%) David Johnson (16%) KeeSean Johnson (13%) Damiere Byrd (13%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** David Johnson (67%, 20, 5) Chase Edmonds (33%, 11, 4)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Air-Raid offense hasn’t produced in the fashion Kingsbury hoped so far, but it’s not all bad, Arizona sits 15th ranked with 363.3 Yds/G. Maybe more importantly, the Cards are 5th in the NFL in plays per game (67.8). Atlanta is 11th (65). There is clearly plenty of room for improvement and the matchup offers a great pace for it. **Kyler Murray (upgrade)** has been getting better every week and should be considered a top-8 QB Sunday. Atlanta boasts a true pass funnel, having a top-10 run defense and second worst pass defense - the Air-Raid should be firing on all cylinders. **Larry Fitzgerald (upgrade)** will be the primary target if **Christian Kirk** is forced to miss another game (currently questionable w/ankle). ATL has been abysmal against the slot, giving up 20.36 FPPG (Next Gen Stats) - Fitz is an upside WR2. It appears Kirk is a game time call, and should be considered a WR2 as well if he suits up - Atlanta is giving up a league worst 31.1 FPPG to wideouts.  Don’t start a tight end in Kingsbury’s offense.


**RB Breakdown**


**David Johnson** is looking like a true game time decision, although it appears he'll try and give it a shot to play. This is the worst case scenario for fantasy owners, and it's likely that backup **Chase Edmonds** is involved even with DJ active to lighten his workload. He needs to be owned across the board. If DJ is forced to miss Sunday’s action, Edmonds will immediately assumed a RB1 workload. Even against ATL’s good run defense, the passing volume for the running backs will keep their floors high.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Le’Veon Bell (84%, 22, 9) Ty Montgomery (13%, 2, 0) Bilal Powell (3%, 1, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Jets savior has returned just in time to possibly flip the script on their disappointing season. **Sam Darnold** will be available for the first time since being diagnosed with mono, but he’s not an option for 1 QB leagues at this point. The offense’s outlook is much improved with Darnold returning as Luke Falk was just awful, but Dallas isn’t a great matchup. **Jamison Crowder (downgrade)** will have better weeks, but the Cowboys are only giving up 12.22 FPPG to slot receivers (Next Gen Stats). **Robbie Anderson (downgrade)** frankly shouldn’t be seeing lineups right now until we see how things play out with Darnold back. Tight end **Chris Herndon (stash)** was set to make his return this week but strained his hamstring last Friday working out. He needs to be owned for his upside, and should be ready to play in a couple weeks as the hammy is only a grade 1 strain. **Ryan Griffin** isn’t a fantasy option.  


**RB Breakdown**


**Le’veon Bell** is getting an RB1 workload but only producing RB2/Flex numbers. The Jets offensive woes haven’t been helping the talented running back, and neither did the year off as he admitted recently. The return of Darnold should improve Bell’s outlook and Dallas isn’t an imposing matchup giving up 21.1 FPPG to running backs. Consider Bell an RB2 with RB1 upside. 


**Cowboys**


**Opp (NYJ) Pass DVOA:** #13

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Ezekiel Elliot (93%, 14, 3) Tony Pollard (7%, 4, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Bill Simmons said in a recent podcast that Dallas might be a “good, bad team”. Essentially meaning they beat up on the bad teams and lose to the good ones. It seems like an accurate description of the Cowboys season so far. The Jets have been mediocre on defense, but it’s probably due to being on the field the entire game as their offense keeps putting them in terrible positions. **Dak Prescott** should be treated as a QB1, but it’s not a smash spot for him or the wideouts. **Amari Cooper** and **Michael Gallup** are both receiving a huge target share, and with **Randall Cobb** popping up on the injury report late week could see more (is that possible?). Cooper is a matchup proof WR1 and Gallup is an upside WR3. If Cobb misses the game, **Devin Smith** will see action but isn’t a recommended play. **Jason Witten** continues to be a low-end TE1 and is an option for desperate owners. At this point outside of the top-3 options, doing well at the tight end position is finding someone to fall into the endzone. 


**RB Breakdown**


The Cowboys may be missing two offensive tackles this week. **Ezekiel Elliot** finished 12-62-1 without T Tyron Smith last week against the Packers back-end run defense. However, this was probably due more in part to the Packers taking a huge lead and forcing Dallas to abandon the run early, rather than offensive line woes. Zeke should be fired up as usual but keep expectations tempered. His volume and goal line work will always provide a high-floor.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Derrick Henry (61%, 20, 0) Dion Lewis (40%, 4, 4)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Titans offense has been a rollercoaster ride this year, and **Marcus Mariota (downgrade)** is a big part of that. In their two wins, he’s gone above 23 fantasy points both times, but in their losses he’s averaged about 13 points. He’s no more than a QB2 streamer, and doesn’t have a great matchup with Denver giving up the 4th fewest FPPG to QBs through 5 weeks. You can likely do better on the wire. **AJ Brown** and **Corey Davis** are early frontrunners for the Jeff Fisher trophy, awarded to the most talented player who is criminally wasted by their team. In Dynasty leagues Brown is one of the better investments considering Mariota isn’t guaranteed to be on this roster past 2019 and his talent is enormous, but the path to consistent fantasy value this season is thin. This week, talented CB Chris Harris Jr. is unlikely to shadow either WR, and with Brown’s snap count was on the rise in Week 5, so he is worth rostering on talent alone. His target share is just too small to trust. Davis has gotten more targets, but outside of a Week 4 TD, has little to show for it. If you have to play one, Brown is the choice simply because he has displayed some major big play ability this year. Neither player is more than a low floor flex play this week. **Delanie Walker (upgrade)** profiles with a better outlook due to his consistently high target share, and is probably the best TD bet amongst receiving options for the Titans as Mariota looks his way consistently in the red zone. Despite two recent duds, Walker is still a borderline TE1 at an extremely thin position.


**RB Breakdown**


Despite a complete lack of involvement in the passing game, **Derrick Henry (upgrade)** has managed to get over 11 points (.5 PPR) in every game this year. The Titans have wisely phased **Dion Lewis (handcuff only)** out of the offense completely, aside for the occasional 2 minute drill or 3rd down situation, leaving a high volume of carries for Henry on a weekly basis. His floor is lower than other elite backs, but Henry remains on the RB1/2 borderline due to his TD upside. The Broncos have been a below average rush-defense by DVOA metrics and have given up the 5th most FPPG to RBs. Henry is a great bet to get into the endzone in what projects as a grind-it-out type game, and will likely exceed 75 yards rushing on volume alone as Tennessee rides him to attempt an upset on the road.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Phillip Linsday (46%, 19, 4) Royce Freeman (54%, 15, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Things haven’t come easy for the Broncos this year, but a win against the Chargers last week was a huge step in the right direction. **Joe Flacco (I wouldn’t)** has been able to sustain two fantasy relevant RBs and WRs so far this year, somewhat to the surprise of preseason predictions. However, Flacco himself is only in consideration as a streamer these days, and going up against a stout Titans defense in a likely low scoring game, this is not the game to try your luck. **Courtland Sutton** has slightly overtaken **Emmanuel Sanders** on the season for overall target share, but both work in tandem as dual lead receivers for Flacco. The Titans are not especially tough against the pass, but do have a solid secondary. This feels like a game that Denver would win with defense and a strong running game, and the likelihood of a shootout does not seem high. Both Sutton and Sanders are in play as WR3s this week, and Sutton is the slightly preferred play due to his recent hot streak. If defenses start treating Sutton as the #1, it’s possible Sanders could break out in the next few weeks, but it may just be that Sutton is slowly overtaking the veteran as the lead dog here. **Noah Fant** is not getting the necessary volume to be trusted and is a low-end TE2 that you are hoping finishes with a 2-50-1 line. Don’t do it unless you are really desperate.


**RB Breakdown**


The split between **Phillip Lindsay (upgrade PPR)** and **Royce Freeman (downgrade)** has been almost exactly even this season, but Lindsay has done slightly more with his touches the past few weeks. His involvement in the passing game gives him a higher floor than Freeman, despite Freeman playing slightly more snaps, so he’s a safer start than his counterpart. The Titans have been vulnerable to pass catching backs in previous weeks, giving up the 8th most receptions to opposing RBs, but overall are solid against the run (9th fewest FPPG to RBs). Lindsay is a low-end RB2 with more upside in PPR, and Freeman is a bye week flex option, albeit one that likely needs a rushing TD to get over 10 points for only the second time this year (.5 PPR). Lindsay’s 3 rush TDs to Freeman’s 0 rush TDs are a concerning trend for Freeman owners, and a welcome sight for those riding the Lip Lindsay train.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Watching **Mason Rudolph** go limp was a scary sight last week, but miraculously he was able to practice throughout this week. He was ruled out, however, and the Steelers have named **Devlin Hodges** the starting QB for Week 6. Hodges is an easy avoid in all formats and any depth, but its not clear how much of a drop off he is from Rudolph in terms of keeping the Steelers weapons fantasy relevant. Hodges spread out his targets pretty evenly amongst the Steelers passing options in his short week 5 audition. **Juju Smith Schuster** finished with perhaps his most complete game of the season, but with Hodges now the starting QB he can’t be trusted as more than a WR2 at this point. He got 2 targets from Hodges, but figures to be the clear top option for the rookie. **James Washington** has been ruled out “for a couple weeks” (Rotoworld) further increasing the likelihood of Schuster’s high target share. Stud CB Casey Hayward typically hasn’t travelled into the slot, so Juju’s not expected to be in a true shadow matchup. Start him, but keep expectations in check. **Diontae Johnson (downgrade)** had been gaining some momentum the past few weeks, but gets a bigger downgrade with Rudolph’s absence. He’s a dart throw WR4/5 in this matchup. **Vance McDonald (upgrade)** appears close to full health, and got three targets in his return last week. He makes for an interesting play as the safety valve for a rookie QB going up against a strong pass rush, but is still only a borderline top 10 option due to the uncertainty of role. The Chargers are middle of the pack against TEs, so his matchup is not a downgrade to his outlook.


**RB Breakdown**


The Steelers injury troubles continued last week, as they lost **Jaylen Samuels (drop shallow leagues)** to a knee injury that will keep him out for about a month. This opens up additional carries and targets for **James Conner (upgrade PPR)** who should now be the centerpiece of the offense. Conner still has yet to get over 55 rushing yards on the season, but will be a popular target of the rookie QB this week, so he needs to stay locked into lineups. He’s a high-end RB2 this week in PPR, and a low-end RB2 in standard leagues.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Melvin Gordon (46%, 16, 6) Austin Ekeler (66%, 18, 16)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Chargers offense looked extremely out of sync against the Broncos last week, and it appears that injuries and poor play along the offensive line may be catching up to them. The Steelers have been much better defensively since adding Minkah Fitzpatrick, so they are no longer a cushy matchup for opposing QBs. **Phillip Rivers (downgrade)** put up a dud in Week 5 after back to back 20+ point weeks, and may lean more heavily on the run game in likely positive game flow. He has potential for 250 and 2 TDs, but is no more than an upper tier QB2 that could be streamed if an owner is short due to bye weeks. **Keenan Allen (upgrade)** was inexplicably covered by LBs on a high % of his routes when he matched up against the Steelers last year, and should be heavily targeted in the short to intermediate pass game if the Chargers O-Line continues to struggle. He is still in the WR1 ranks. **Mike Williams (downgrade)** put up a solid 6-74 line in Week 5, but still has yet to reach the endzone. The combination of a stout pass defense, likely positive game flow, and the lack of protection for Rivers to take deep shots all point to a downgrade for Williams. If you are starting him, you’re hoping he can get in the endzone. **Hunter Henry (stash)** returned to a limited practice on Thursday and is officially questionable to play, but may be on a snap count if he does. He isn’t a trustworthy Week 6 option, but needs to be universally owned as he will be back to the TE1 ranks likely by next week.


**RB Breakdown**


The Week 5 return of **Melvin Gordon (upgrade standard)** didn’t yield immediate results for the Chargers, but a bigger Week 6 role is likely in the cards. **Austin Ekeler (upgrade PPR)** isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, but Gordon should get 15+ carries and 4+ targets, and has a good chance for a TD as a home favorite against a middle of the pack rush defense. Treat him as an RB2 who may struggle for consistent yardage as long as the Chargers O-Line is undermanned. Ekeler received an incredible 16 targets in Week 5, so is obviously still in the game plan moving forward. As Gordon gets up to speed, Ekeler may be stuck in the 5-8 carry range, but remains an RB2 in PPR leagues due to his pass game involvement. He’s a big play machine, so don’t hesitate to get him in your lineup for at least another week.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Coming off of a Week 5 bye, this will be a true test for whether **Matthew Stafford (downgrade)** can put up good numbers against an above average defense. The Packers have given up the 7th fewest FPPG to opposing QBs, and rank as a top 5 pass defense by DVOA. We expect a heavy dose of the run game and at least one interception from the GB defense, so we have him outside the top 12 this week. He is still a high-end QB2 due to his weapons and increased tendency to take deep shots this year, but the volume may not be there as much in this matchup. **Kenny Golladay (upgrade standard)** has only gotten over 67 yards once this season in 4 games, but has gotten in the endzone 4 times. He gets a slight downgrade in PPR, and will take aim at a difficult matchup with excellent Packers’ CBs, but is a solid WR2 based on TD upside and his status as the #1 option in this offense. **Marvin Jones (downgrade)** may see a bit more of rising star CB Jaire Alexander, so he is a riskier start with a low floor but an obviously high ceiling. Consider him a boom-bust WR3 in this difficult matchup. **TJ Hockenson (downgrade)** appears on track to play, but still needs to officially pass concussion protocol. Assuming he’s healthy, he is a high-end TE2 due to the scarcity of depth at the position, but will likely need to get into the endzone to be a worthwhile start. Because he plays on Monday night, owners may be forced to go in another direction if he hasn’t been cleared by the early kickoffs on Sunday morning. With Danny Amendola a limited participant in practice and likely to play, that makes Hockenson’s path to targets all the more challenging.


**RB Breakdown**


The Lions showed an improved run game in Week 4 against the Chiefs, and **Kerryon Johnson** finally got the workhorse treatment owners had been waiting for. Fresh off a rest week, KJ goes up against a Packers rush D that has struggled by DVOA metrics and given up the 3rd most FPPG to RBs. We have him as a top-12 play this week in a game he should see a heavy workload. The Lions best chance for a road upset is to feed the beast and keep the Aaron’s off the field. **Ty Johnson** and **J.D McKissick** are reportedly battling for the #2 role, so neither makes for an attractive handcuff until one emerges. KJ is the man, and has a good shot at a big game in Week 6.


#**Packers**


**Opp (DET) Pass DVOA:** #12


**Opp (DET) Run DVOA:** #14


**Injuries to Watch DEF (DET):** DT Mike Daniels (OUT), Amani Oruwariye (OUT), CB Darius Slay (limited, Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (GB):** Davante Adams (DNP, Doubtful), Q Aaron Rodgers (limited Friday, likely to play) 


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Davante Adams (25%) Marquez Valdes-Scantling (18%) Aaron Jones (13%) Jimmy Graham (11%) Geronimo Allison (11%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Aaron Jones (68%, 26, 8) Jamaal Williams *Week 3 (61%, 14, 2)


QB/WR/TE Breakdown


Owners of **Aaron Rodgers (downgrade)** had to be frustrated last week watching him hand off the ball to Aaron Jones in the red zone time and time again. Had he been able to turn even two of those drives into passing TDs his line would have been much more appetizing. This is perhaps a sign of things to come, however, as the Packers are content to run the ball heavily this season. We project somewhat of a bounce back game this week, at least in the TD department, but missing his top weapon lowers his upside significantly. View Rodgers as a back-end QB1 that can be benched if owners have another high-end option with a better matchup. With **Davante Adams** likely out this week due to his turf toe injury (DNP Friday), **Marquez Valdes-Scantling** becomes the de-facto #1 WR again this week. That role didn’t yield much last week, but keeps him in the low-end WR3/4 range. **Darius Slay**, a top level CB who often shadows opposing #1s, is questionable to play with a hammy issue, and his absence would presumably be an upgrade for MVS. **Geronimo Allison (drop)** struggled to cash in on opportunity last week as well, and doesn’t appear to be a big part of the game plan at this point. He’s a threat to get in the end zone, but can’t be viewed as more than a WR4/5 at this point. **Jimmy Graham (upgrade)** got a slight uptick in work sans Adams last week, and remains on the TE1 radar simply due to his QB looking his way on a few jump balls every week. He’s the most likely of the Packers receiving options to hit the end zone this week, and should be in most lineups unless owners have a top-6 option as an alternative.


**RB Breakdown**


The hashtag-FreeAaronJones movement finally got some traction last week as he racked up 4 rushing TDs and 182 total yards. **Jones** got a bigger workload with **Jamaal Williams (handcuff only)** sidelined due to his concussion, and rewarded owners with a monster game. Williams returns this week, so Jones may lose a few touches, but remains a solid RB1 due to his strong O-Line, elite defense, and usage in the red zone. Williams can only be viewed as a handcuff for Jones owners, and shouldn’t be in any lineups, outside of extremely deep leagues, in his first game back from injury.

Mecole Hardman Role Once Hill Returns,"There has been a lot of talk of Hill this week with his potential return, but not a lot of discussion around how this will impact the playing time of the other WRs. It was mainly Hardman who filled in for Hill week 1 when he went down.

Is there a chance that Hardman sees a significant reduction in playing time upon Hill’s return, and the 3 WR sets are Hill, Robinson, and Pringle (since Watkins is likely out)? Anybody have good insight into their projected packages with Hill?

Edit: A lot of the comments don’t seem to be taking Watkins missing time into account. This is something to consider and we haven’t seen what their personnel looks like with Hill in and Watkins out",32,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dh2m7w/mecole_hardman_role_once_hill_returns/,6221.05327583154,r/fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

**Get the advice you need to finally make a decision about your lineup**

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you’re thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he’s been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn’t work out for you, don’t come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don’t do it!

Which DE stands to gain the most from the opposing team's recent O-Line changes.,"Nick bosa just wrecked the browns, still not sure if this is an indictment on the browns or more telling of Bosa's skill as a DE. The Rams O-line is rated the worst in the NFL per pff.

The 49ers have lost RT Mcglinchey, Juscwyzk (albeit primarily blocking FB) and have been pretty good despite being without LT Joe Staley.  Jusczyk was replaced by TE Ross Dwelley and subsequent runs went for little or no gain.

WR depth add - the case for Robbie Anderson,"Oh Robbie, where have you been. After finishing last season finally building a connection with Sam Darnold, seeing double digit targets and stretching the field like you do at your best, you’ve completely  fallen off the radar along with the rest of the Jet’s offense. In fact, you are currently only owned in about 50% of all leagues, depending on the host. Justifiably so based on your near non-existence this season to date. Here is why I’m adding you as depth to my teams where available. 

* Yes you have sucked, and I mean sucked. To start the season however you have played Buf, Cle, and NE (all top ten defenses in points allowed to WR) - plus Phil, which would be the only good matchup. Even in a good matchup, your QB couldn’t throw the ball accurately downfield if it was on a zip line. Simply put, nobody has stood a chance in this offense, but...

* Sam Darnold has returned from the dreaded kissing disease. I’m advocating a depth add here, because simply put, we can’t expect Darnold to return to form after an illness related absence like this first game, but...

* Bye weeks are coming in full swing, and injuries are joining them. Pickings are thin at WR, and if you’re scouting the waiver wire you’ll likely not see too many appealing adds. While the Jet’s early situation and schedule have been brutal, things are looking up because...

* Rest of season schedule for the Jets is like a complete reversal of the first five weeks. After Dallas and a dreaded match up with NE, the schedule turns to cupcake mode. Eight of their last nine games are against bottom half WR points per game defense. The likes of the Miami Dolphins, *twice!* Oak, Was, the Giants. This schedule sets up for a strong finish, and what could be a valuable add if you are hurting at WR.

Fantasy is a lot of luck, but taking all of this into account, I feel this is an add that can pay off through the end of the season. It’s likely your league is in free agency mode until tomorrow’s games start. If you’re looking for depth and a potential situational starter, Anderson might just be your ticket.",50,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dh167w/wr_depth_add_the_case_for_robbie_anderson/,6337.386609399318,r/fantasyfootball

Can we trust Adrian Peterson one last time?,"Peterson (along with the rest of the Redskins) has been a complete dumpster fire so far. QB carousel, Gruden gets fired and a lackluster Defense has made this team play from behind every game so far. This has led to limited touches for AP and some very low scores thus far.

But now they get to play the only other team that looks worse then them, the Dolphins. Miami has given up the most points to RB’s and Washington’s interim coach has already said he wants to lean heavily on the  RB’s this game.  If there was ever a time to start the walking hall of famer, it’s this week. Is anyone else feeling like taking the risk of starting him, or should we play it a bit safer with someone else.

No love for Tevin Coleman,"For some reason Coleman is getting no respect from experts this week and beyond and I can't figure out why. He came back into a lead rushing role with the best rushing offence in football. His first game back (in a blowout) he had a 36% snap count and led the team with 16 touches. 

While Brieda's stat line looked better, removing his first touch of the game he had 10 carries for 31 yards. Now obviously a player as skilled as Breida has the potential to break a run like that every game and that's why he will continue to be valuable but Tevin was ripping off chunk plays at ease. He had a 6.1 ypc with a long of 19 yards. That's insane efficiency.

This week he plays the Rams, which may be the best defense they have faced but they just finished allowing 136 yards rushing and another 36 in the air to RB's against a team very similar to the 9ers.

Even though Breida got a redzone receiving TD last game, most people feel like Coleman is the redzone back and Jeff Wilson proved how valuable that is. Coleman is also a good pass catcher and even though he didn't catch a ball last game I don't expect that to be the norm. He caught 2 balls for 33 yards in less than a half week 1

With all that it amazes me how low he is being ranked this week. Boris Chen hasn't been updated since thursday but fantasy pros has him somewhere around RB 31 around guys like Freeman, Sanders and McCoy, all of which appear to be the 1B in a RBBC. Breida is sitting almost 10 spots ahead of him at RB 23.

Is Tyreek Hill a Sell high or hold hard?,"The case for hold:
Tyreek hill is expected to return this week (fingers crossed) and will have a extremely favorable match up against the Texans who have given up the 7th most points to Wr, he is also expected to get a serious number of targets due to a lack luster reciever set that lacks consistency everywhere but TE pos, and with watkins injured it's not gona get any better, this indicates a really high amount of points for tyreek in the weeks to come  

The Case for Selling high: he has good value to the before hand, however after this Texans game hes got a really tough ROS including 2 games against deaver, chicago, and New england...
On top of that he may still miss this game or at least some snaps this game due to still recovering... and to top it all off with this injury there is a high change of reaggrivating the injury... with all of this being known there is a good chance that this is currently the highest hes going to be worth all season being value right around Leonard fournettes level.

Need a TE this weekend? The case for Geoff Swain as a bye-week fill-in,"Okay, hear me out - Swain isn't a sexy pick. He's not a great pick. He might be average.

But at TE, that might be enough. Here is the breakdown for teams that target the TE the most:

* [Top 10 targets at TE](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/reports/targets-distribution/te.php?year=2019&start=1&end=5&show=totals)

See #10? That's the Jags, whose current #1 TE - James O'Shaughnessy - was put on IR this past week. What's interesting is that before he was hurt, the target share between O'Shaughnessy and Swaim was as such through five games:

* O'Shaughnessy - 20 targets
* Swaim - 15 targets

What's more interesting are the two TE's routes run percentages and red-zone rates:

[O'Shaughnessy](https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/james-oshaughnessy/):

* Snap Share = 61.9%  (27.0% slot)
* Route Participation = 48.6%
* Target Share = 11.8%  (23.5% rz)

[Swaim](https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/geoff-swaim/): 

* Snap Share = 49.5%  (27.0% slot)
* Route Participation = 33.5% 
* Target Share = 8.9%  (5.9% rz)


Between the two men, nearly 30% of all red-zone targets were coming their way. Now that O'Shaughnessy is out for the year, Swaim's numbers likely won't go up to the point of being an every-week starter. But the potential is there for increased red-zone looks and a much higher target share against a team - New Orleans - that is squarely average against the TE position. 

That said, there's quite a bit to like here. The Jags were already top 10 in targets to their TEs. Considering how often they throw at them in the red-zone and that another TE - Seth DeValve - will likely take the Swaim role now, there's a good chance Swaim makes you feel less despair at the TE position this weekend. 

He also has a True Catch Rate of 85.7% on his targets, and, if you're playing in a PPR or half-PPR league, it's not unreasonable to expect a decent performance from this guy. Plus, he's already used to running routes at the slot, which means he could - if needed - play the same role as O'Shaughnessy in that position. 

Don't except miracles. Expect an average performance, one that won't hurt your team, and you'll be fine. Sometimes winning means guarding against goose eggs, and Swaim seems like a good fit to help us avoid that fate.

Good luck this weekend. 👍",213,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgyf5c/need_a_te_this_weekend_the_case_for_geoff_swain/,6553.436609713236,r/fantasyfootball

I  know they have DFS tournaments that just use one game , but this is a season long league. I’m not purposefully trying to use this lineup but it just so happens these are the players I could field. Wondering if anyone out there has started a lineup that’s over with in 1 game? If any game would be a candidate I feel like this COULD be it. I don’t know how often this scenario plays out for other league owners o but it’s looking likely for me to do so.",17,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgy0vg/a_starting_lineup_only_composed_of_players_from/,6584.119943098227,r/fantasyfootball
Tracking Fantasy Footballers Starts of the Week- stats through week 5,"I get bored at work a lot. I also like listening to the Fantasy Footballers podcast. One of their segments I enjoy other than just their overall rankings is their Starts of the Week. These past few weeks have me wondering: just how accurate are their predictions?

So I threw together a little spreadsheet tracking all of their weekly picks and their rankings through the weeks.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kJkVmGUA6ZQOLqUl2EVwvO8u2XX1LoQY

All of the scores are using ESPN standard scoring right now. I might be adding PPR in a later revision. EDIT: ESPN standard PPR has been added as a second tab. 

TL;DR - Mike has been the most accurate through week 5, with 11 of his 20 picks ending up in the top 12 for their position (10 for PPR).

Fun fact: So far this year, Jason has not picked a kicker that finished outside the top 24.",20,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgy04y/tracking_fantasy_footballers_starts_of_the_week/,6585.619943118096,r/fantasyfootball

Maximizing Your (Kickoff) Return on Investment: Week 6,"Back and ready to talk everything about returners for week 6. As always these posts are targeted for people who are in leagues that score return yards with the preferred scoring being 1 point per 10 return yards. 

Desmond King was the only guy to run one back last week with a nice 68-yard return. Brandon Wilson and Cordarrelle Patterson were the closest to hit the century mark with a 97-yard and 93-yard game, respectively. 

Hope everyone’s week goes well. [Here are the projections for week 6.](https://mobile.twitter.com/SLFootballGuys/status/1181742559271559168/photo/1)

Good Returners for Week 6:

Tyler Lockett (KR/PR) - Most likely will be returning kicks Sunday, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Penny gets action from deep. Lockett has been more productive in that department so I wouldn’t expect that to change. Even if Penny gets the call, Lockett should get some chances in the punt game as Cleveland has shown to struggle to move the ball this season.

Mecole Hardman (KR) - Mecole went back to kick return duties last week and I would imagine he would stay with it with Tyreek’s  return to the field coming in the next few weeks. Houston’s touchback percentage is bottom 10 in the league and with how susceptible Houston’s secondary has been he’s a play you can be confident in after a down week last week.

JoJo Natson (KR/PR) - Hasn’t done a whole lot so far this year, but that should change this week. San Francisco has been putting up points this year and when you combine that with a 50% touchback percentage on the year (46.67% on the road), that’s a recipe for a big day for the returner of the Rams.

Tremon Smith (KR) - IDP special of the week, this is a perfect return matchup as the Lions have the worst touchback percentage in the league at 34.78%. Should have plenty of chances on Monday night.

Returners I’m Fading for Week 6:

Miles Sanders (KR) - Not seeing much upside in this matchup against Minnesota for Sanders. Not only has the Vikings’ defense been solid against the run, but they’ve been rocking an 80% touchback percentage on kickoffs. 

Jakeem Grant (KR/PR) - I can absolutely see some broken plays in this game and Jakeem can be a part of some, but this seems too risky of a play this week. Washington has kicked off at a touchback percentage of 75% and his chances seem limited.

Dontrell Hilliard (KR) - He had a solid return game last week, but this week isn’t a great matchup for him. Seattle has kicked a touchback on 84% of kicks this year and since he hasn’t had much offensive involvement since his concussion week 1, he’s a strong fade this week.

For those of you that want to see these calculations before waivers each week, I’ll have them up on our [twitter every Tuesday night.](https://mobile.twitter.com/SLFootballGuys)",11,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgx6ul/maximizing_your_kickoff_return_on_investment_week/,6648.553276534875,r/fantasyfootball

**Get the advice you need to finally make a decision about your lineup**

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you’re thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he’s been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn’t work out for you, don’t come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don’t do it!

Steelers Backfield: No Use for Snell?,"Is there a reason nobody is talking about Benny Snell?

Jaylen has a lot of vacated snaps being out for the next month of so and with ""Deal With the Devlin"" Hodges under center, they may lean on the run or short game more.

It seems like Snell could step right into a role along side Conner, especially since he hasn't exactly lived up to his own hype. Is it worth trying to stash him in deeper leagues? Is the volume enough for him like it almost was for Samuels? Or is he just not as good of a player?",30,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgwsun/steelers_backfield_no_use_for_snell/,6679.186610019207,r/fantasyfootball

8. PHI (Vikings @ WASH play them here)
9. WASH
10. CLE
11. Back to MIA

What players from your team are currently injured but could return? What are the fantasy implications?,"So I was thinking about the Patriots injury situation and who might be able to return at some point which got me wondering - what impact players on other teams could come back at some point and affect fantasy football?  

​

For instance, the Patriots have a few players on IR that could potentially return, the most likely to have a big impact being left tackle Isaiah Wynn.  Wynn had won the starting left tackle job until a toe injury landed him on IR but pretty much everyone around the team is suggesting he is a lock to be chosen as one of the IR guys to return.  He would be eligible week 11.  Getting Wynn back could improve the entire offense but the three guys it would likely impact the most are Sony Michel, Brady, and Ryan Izzo.  

​

Michel and Brady are obvious ones but Izzo could see a bump into relevancy for really deep leagues or daily fantasy.  With Wynn out, Izzo has been asked to stay in and block a ton - he played 79 snaps this week but only ran 31 routes and was asked to pass block on 12 pass plays which isn't sustainable usage for a fantasy tight end (most viable TEs block on 10% or less of pass plays and over the last 4 weeks Izzo has blocked on 26% of his).  Obviously we don't know for sure if his usage would change and it would be tough to rely on him in fantasy playoffs in any real league but something to think about.  In week 5 the Pats didn't have much trouble with the Redskins defense so Izzo didn't block on any pass plays and he scored a touchdown.  

​

You can only bring 2 guys back from IR so the options for the second spot would likely be James Develin in week 12 (boost for Sony) or N'Keal Harry in week 9 (he didn't look great in preseason but him getting snaps upon his return would likely hurt Dorsett, if anyone).   Rookie lineman Yodny Cajuste is also on the NFI list and the Pats already played their week 6 game so he can come back at any point moving forward.  

​

So what about your favorite NFL team?  Any guys that are slated to return at some point that the rest of us should know about? (especially if it's under the radar a bit, we all know about AJ Green)",28,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgwc38/what_players_from_your_team_are_currently_injured/,6716.136610066891,r/fantasyfootball

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Get the advice you need to finally make a decision about your lineup**

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you’re thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he’s been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn’t work out for you, don’t come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don’t do it!

For either of those two parties, what is Hunter Henry's value for the rest of the season, or is it too early to tell?

Has Christopher Harris lost his way a bit? Am i alone in thinking this?,"The last few years i would listen to podcasts nonstop at work,  the footballers, cbs, and harris.  harris always gave the best insight to everything in my eyes.  less entertaining than the other shows but his info was better.  this year i made an effort to not listen to any podcasts so i could focus on my gut instincts and not be swayed in my drafts by others influence.  the previous 2 years i went with the ""experts"" advice on sleepers and what not and they were the most miserable years of my 11 year fantasy life.  

well its like a third through the season and i started to listen to hear recaps of games.  the first harris podcast i listened to he badmouthed the commentating of a game and played a clip from a sideline reporter for like 5 minutes.  like cool i get what they say on tv isnt exactly the most hard hitting journalism but thats not what i tune in for.  the second harris podcast i listen to he is basically saying how much better he is than other shows because he doesnt go by just stats.   


i remember from like 2 years ago he was basically claiming that he was the only one to call that gurley was gonna be a stud after his abysmal 2nd year, even berry called that gurley was gonna be a stud that year.  i havent listened to any shows where he has guests on this year but last year it seemed like he basically dismissed all of their arguments as ""crutch"" arguments and that he was right no matter what.  the episode i listened to today was him just reading twitter comments of people that agreed with his views.  i turned it off before cousin josh came on which is a shame because cousin josh reminds me of Steve Buschemi.

his ""snark"" has always irritated me and he seems like he is just so full of himself.  his nicknames for players is always garbage to me but i kept listening because he gave great insight.  now i cant even get through a full podcast because i cant take his ""snark"".  anyone else feel this way?

Edit: thanks for the insight  /u/extrapudding",234,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgrvdb/has_christopher_harris_lost_his_way_a_bit_am_i/,7184.38661031723,r/fantasyfootball
Why David Johnson Will Score Below His Projection This Week,"David Johnson's main production this season has come through the air. The cardinals throw to their running backs 22% of their attempts (This is 7th in the league). When it comes to rushing yards and touchdowns David Johnson is middle of the pack with 264 yards and 1 touchdown on 64 runs. The 2nd string running back Chase Edmonds has 127 rushing yards and a touchdown on a measly 19 carries.

They are taking on an Atlanta Defense that doesn't do anything very well, except for forcing incomplete passes to running backs. They force in-completions to running backs 65% of the time. This is fifth best in the league. The Falcons give up the highest completion rate to wide receivers in the entire league at 67% of the time.

The Cardinals throw it to their wide receivers on 72% of pass plays. I see the cardinals completely abandoning the targets to the running backs this week and moving the ball easily. The rushing TD's will go to Murray who has more rushing TD's than both running backs.

This leaves DJ to rely on passing yards and completions. For whatever reason the Falcons can shut down the pass catching running backs this year. So look for DJ to score below his projection.

The case for Malcolm Brown and more so why SF's Run Defense may not be as good as we think.,"So far I've seen many people say they're not starting Brown because of SF's strong run D. So far they have been stellar, shutting down team's run games, however, this may be a bit misleading based on who they've played.

Week 1 they played the stellar RB duo of Peyton Barber and Ronald Jones. hese two combined for 21/108/0 - Good for a 5.1 YPC

Week 2 they played an injured Joe Mixon and a Bengals putrid OL. They shut them down and held he and Gio to an impressive 17/23/0 statline. A good game but we have to remember that Mixon was hurt going into the week and the Bengals were down 14 going into half and 24 in the fourth. Absolute horrid game script to boot.

Week 3 they did a good job combating James Conner, holding him to 13/43/0. Pretty average for what Conner has done the past three weeks. Not hard to scheme against the Steelers with Rudolph at QB. Conner's statlines were similar against BAL (14/55/1) and CIN (10/42/0).

Last week Chubb had 16/87/0 good for a 5.4 YPC with another 12 yards on a catch and run.

**TL;DR:** So far this Defense hasn't been tested by anything near what the Rams are bringing Sunday. They've played the Bucs with Evans sick, Bengals with Mixon hurt, Rudolph led Steelers and smoked the Browns at home last week. They've been good so far. Quite impressive compared to last year, but they're not the Bears or Jags of recent years. I'm sure SF is more focused on stopping Kupp and the Rams vertical attack than Brown. Should make for a good day underneath. I expect a Chubb like game for him with maybe a little fewer touches.",180,0.65,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dglyzc/the_case_for_malcolm_brown_and_more_so_why_sfs/,7745.336610798041,r/fantasyfootball

A low of all lows: starting a Miami Dolphin on offense,"This week the Dolphins will play the abysmal Washington defense. Although this might seem like a “sneaky” start for WR Preston Williams, it might not be what you’re expecting. Although he’s consistently put up 10, 8, 9, and 7, what makes him a sneaky play for this week? Well he’s getting 62% of the touches in the red-zone for the Dolphins, but on the other hand, Miami has only had 8 of those opportunities all year. Even though he’s playing the Redskins, Miami WR Albert Wilson is returning this week, so between Williams, Wilson, and Parker, Preston might not get as many targets this week. I’d recommended only starting him if you’re desperate, like me.",69,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dglwcj/a_low_of_all_lows_starting_a_miami_dolphin_on/,7751.469944151243,r/fantasyfootball

"With all the recent RB1 injuries, consider Adrian Peterson for this week.","Peterson has admittedly been bad this so far year and is available in about 50% of ESPN leagues still. 


However if there is anytime for a good week from him it’s this week. It’s well known Miami’s defense is abysmal, and they’ve allowed the second most points to fantasy RBs this year (most in standard). 


This game also figures to have better gamescripts for Peterson than Washington’s other games this year. These 2 teams will be lucky to combine for 4 wins this season and this figures to be a close game since they’re both dogshit.


With all the RB injuries this week I think Peterson could have a solid game this week. I could see something like 70-80 yards with TD potential. This is the perfect matchup for him.


TL;DR: Miami’s run defense is terrible and positive gamescript for Washington running this week will make Peterson a RB2/flex this week.",35,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgkstv/with_all_the_recent_rb1_injuries_consider_adrian/,7835.919944349925,r/fantasyfootball

Cowboys defense is good but if the jets are playing from behind, it's possible crowder could get a lot of targets. Shot in the dark for fantasy owners but beats a lot of other trash on the waiver wire.

Buy high on Jacobs,"Last week's 22 point affair was no fluke. I like Jacobs ROS more than some of the other backs in the 3rd tier including Ingram, Henry, and maybe even Bell. If you're able to trade for Josh Jacobs this week, I would definitely pull the trigger.

1. Schedule 

According to FantasyPros, the Raiders have the 4th easiest schedule for RBs for the rest of the season. This includes the Bengals (31st), Chiefs (30th), Packers (26th), and Chargers twice (18th). In games like vs Denver and vs Chicago when Gruden leaned on the run-game, Jacobs saw 20+ attempts and found the end zone twice in each game.

2. Offensive Line 

Every year it seems like people get burned at the RB position (it’s me, I’m people) and if it's not because of injury or usage, there's usually one reason why. Players like Bell, Mixon, and Devonta Freeman are all under performing their ADP for one reason: absolute dog shit offensive line. Bell actually has the easiest ROS schedule for RBs but the problem is his offensive line ranks 32nd in run blocking, putting up 3.02 Adj. Line Yards/Attempt with a 28% Stuffed rate (31st). Going back to Jacobs though, the Raiders offensive line ranks 4th in run blocking with 5.06 Adj. Line Yards/Attempt and a 12% Stuffed Rate (3rd). Basically that offensive line makes more holes than Shia Labeouf at a juvenile detention camp and with the way Jacobs runs it's a great recipe.

3. Volume/Scheme 

A little baptism by fire helped Gruden figure out that the Raiders must absolutely build their offensive scheme around Jacobs. They started off with this game plan Week 1 when Jacobs saw a 74% of Offensive Snaps but then his usage regressed in the subsequent weeks: 46%, 42%, and 54 % respectively. In Week 5, with Tyrell Williams out, they were forced to lean on him once again and the result was 68% Off. Snap Pct and 27.8 Fantasy Points (0.5 PPR).

But Gruden has always been a punch-in-the-mouth kind of coach. He's invested heavily in the run game as evident by his offensive line. Waller helps open up the box as well as provides very solid run-blocking. And then there's the fullback Alec Ingold who has been vital to Jacobs' success. Gruden mentioned in his press conference how Ingold's blocking was crucial in the two scores during the Bears game.

*FINAL THOUGHT*

If it's not too late to process your trade this week or have your commissioner push it through before Sunday, I suggest trying to trade for Jacobs this week. Partially this is because he is on BYE and you may be able to sauce over an active RB this week for extra value. Mostly though, I think Jacobs is going to pop off for the rest of the season so go grab that man and never look back.",223,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/dgj4ig/buy_high_on_jacobs/,7960.619944767157,r/fantasyfootball
"Petition to rename ""ROS"" threads","Considering we started ""Rest of Season"" threads for each player after every single week, we should just call them ""Rest of Week"" (ROW).

I still think there is a place for ROS threads, for instance after a big trade or injury... but if we're just going to repose the question because the player had a good or bad game, they just just be called ROW.

Knock on wood if you're with me.

Tyler Boyd Breakdown (With and Without AJ Green '18-'19),"**Tyler Boyd Breakdown (With and Without AJ Green '18-'19)**

I've been reading a lot of comments saying things like ""Boyd will be better when AJ returns"" or ""Boyd won't be as good when AJ returns"". So I wanted to put some stats together from last year and this year for some more information. Interested to see how people will interpret these stats in the comments. Scoring is .5 PPR. 

**TL;DR/Analysis**

||Games|Tgt|Rec|Yds|Y/R|TD|Ctch%|Y/Tgt|Snp Pct|Fantasy|STDEV|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|With AJ|8|8.25|**6.13**|**77.50**|12.39|**0.63**|**73%**|**9.32**|86%|**14.56**|8.46|
|Without AJ|11|**8.55**|5.82|74.00|**13.54**|0.27|68%|9.08|**88%**|11.95|**5.52**|

* Boyd's targets get a slight bump when AJ is out
* Boyd's Y/R does go up when AJ is out. 
* Fantasy points per game increases when AJ plays, but he is less consistent. 
* TD rate significantly drops without AJ.
* Receptions and yards per game are pretty close to the same.
* Catch rate is lower this year, due to Andy Dalton being worse and a new offense (imo)

Personally, I think that Boyd will continue to be pretty close to the same player when AJ comes back, fantasy-wise. I believe the only thing holding him back right now is TDs. Whether those will come or not, I'm not sure. 

**Game by game stats below with averages...**

Here we have Weeks 10-15. AJ came back to play in Week 13 but left shortly after the game started, only playing 25% of snaps and receiving 1 target. For that reason, I've included Week 13 in this set of games. Also of note - Boyd left Week 15 early due to injury and only played 49% of snaps.

The Week 6 slate provides a grudge match between two NFC South contenders, with the loser facing an uphill battle to win the division. **Cam Newton**  may have lost Carolina’s Week 2 TNF matchup against the Bucs with his inaccurate arm, but they still had a chance to win the game with CMC’s legs in the closing seconds, until he was stuffed at the goal line. **Kyle Allen (upgrade)**  has been used primarily as a game manager and taken a backseat to the CMC show, but with TB having the No. 1 run defense so far, they may be pushed to get the ball in the air this week to win. He can be considered a back-end QB1. **Curtis Samuel (upgrade)**  and **D.J. Moore (upgrade)**  were both victims of Newton’s struggles in the first meeting of the year, but Tampa’s secondary was ripe for exploitation - Newton just couldn’t get the ball to his speedy receivers, missing Samuel on several deep throws or getting the ball to him late, causing him to be tackled well short of where the play could have gone. TB is giving up the most FPPG to opposing wideouts and Carolina will begin to hit on the deep ball at some point, this week could very well be it. Consider both upside WR3’s. **Greg Olsen**  also draws an extremely favorable matchup, TB is giving up the second most FPPG to tight ends (12.5) and Olsen should be considered a top-6 tight end this week.      


**RB Breakdown** 


**Christian McCaffery**  continues to eat and is still in the mix for the overall RB1, even going against the best run defense in the league so far. His involvement in all facets of the game keep his floor high. He’s questionable but expected to play, owners should grab **Reggie Bonnafun**  in case CMC’s health goes sideways before kickoff.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The roller coaster ride of having **Jameis Winston** on your fantasy squad continues to provide it’s peaks and valleys. There have been more peaks this season than years past and Winston is the #10 QB through 5 weeks. Even in a down week loss to the Saints last week, Winston put up a respectable 17.5 fantasy points and didn’t turn the ball over once. It’s possible he’s turned a corner, but it’s also just as likely that the next bust week is right around the corner… The emergence of **Chris Godwin** has certainly helped the oft-scrutinized quarterback, and Godwin has become a true WR1 in fantasy - he’s sitting pretty as the overall WR1 through 5 weeks. Godwin’s ascent has brought fellow wideout **Mike Evans** back to earth, as he only saw 3 targets last week in his duel with Saints stud CB Marcus Lattimore. Next on deck is a matchup with another elite CB in James Bradberry, a player that has thwarted Evans multiple times in his career, including their last matchup in Week 2. Consider Evans a feast-or-famine WR2 this week in the bad matchup. With field stretcher **Breshad Perriman** not traveling to London, tight end **O.J Howard**  is in a position to gain a larger target share. It may not matter however, as the Panthers have the leagues fifth-best defense against tight ends, only giving up a stingy 4 FPPG to the position. Howard is impossible to trust at this point and should be considered a TE2. 


**RB Breakdown** 


**Peyton Barber**  and **Ronald Jones** continue to kill each others value and neither should be treated as more than RB3’s. Going up against one of the league's worst run defenses is a prime position to get a boom week out of one of these players, but it’s impossible to know who will get the volume to produce. **Dare Ogunbowale** isn’t seeing the field enough to be a fantasy asset, leave him on the wire.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Bengals couldn’t snag their first win in the participation trophy bowl last week, but it’s ok because Zac Taylor believes his team is all “going in the same direction”. Um, ok i guess. **Andy Dalton** did show signs of life in the 4th quarter, finishing with 262 yards and 2 TDs, but continues to be inconsistent and makes numerous mistakes every week. The Ravens have not been good on defense this year, and will be without CB Jimmy Smith again this week, but Dalton is no more than a bye week QB2 filler, albeit one in a projected shootout. **Tyler Boyd** gets a tough matchup against Humphrey, but his volume keeps him in the WR2 mix, especially in PPR leagues. **Auden Tate (upgrade)** should be the beneficiary with easier matchups, and he makes for a solid low end WR3 based on his usage the past few weeks. **Tyler Eifert (drop)** couldn’t get it going even against Arizona last week, so if you haven’t yet done him the courtesy of putting him back on the wire, do so now for his dignity as much as yours.


**RB Breakdown** 


In their first drive last week the Bengals ran almost every play, and their continuous chunk plays should have led to a TD. But after that drive, they struggled to generate any running lanes, and steadily gave up on the run game as the Cardinals jumped out to a lead. **Joe Mixon (downgrade PPR)** hit a season-high in rushing with 93 yards, but 60 of those were on the opening drive. He also turned his one target into a 16 yard catch. Mixon’s lack of involvement in the passing game is a big problem, as the Bengals will likely be in negative game flow for a majority of their remaining games. With the Bengals below-average offense not reaching the red zone very often, Mixon’s chances for rushing TD’s have decreased as well. If the Ravens get off to a good start, it’s easy to imagine Mixon finishing with around 75 rushing yards, no TD, and one catch for 10 yards again this week. That 8-10 point line is decent for an RB2, but makes for a risky start in PPR leagues, and isn’t the type of production owners that drafted Mixon early are counting on him for. Consider him a back end RB2 that needs to either get into the end zone or bust a big play in the passing game to have any chance at a ceiling game. **Gio Bernard (stash)** continues to out target Mixon, and has run more routes overall this season as well. He has no standalone value, but in the event of a Mixon injury, would potentially be a more valuable play than Mixon has been so far because of his likely 3 down role. He’s a valuable handcuff to roster at this point.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:**  Mark Ingram (65%, 21, 2)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Ravens offense has cooled a bit in recent weeks, but they have still put up 23+ points in every game. **Lamar Jackson (upgrade)** has been a top-5 QB based mostly on his rushing ability, and he’s put in enough in the passing game to make him an every week set and forget. He’s no Pat Mahomes, but he’s also no Tim Tebow either. **Mark Andrews (upgrade)**  is tied for the highest target share on the team, and is an easy top-6 TE at an extremely thin position. The Cincy defense is 7th stingiest against TE’s (NFL.com) but Andrews will be a target hog this week, especially if the Ravens are missing their top WR. **Marquise Brown (downgrade PPR)**  is questionable to play after missing practice Wednesday and Thursday, so his status is worth monitoring closely heading into the weekend. If he does play, he makes for a solid WR3 because of his high target volume and big play ability, but may not be needed much if the Ravens pound the run at home. If he is forced to miss the game, **Willie Snead**  would enter the streaming radar as he has shown a solid connection with Jackson so far. Even as the top WR, however, he’d be no more than a WR4 with some decent PPR upside.


**RB Breakdown** 


The Ravens haven’t been quite as run heavy as some predicted, but **Mark Ingram (upgrade)**  has gotten just enough volume to be a top-10 RB so far this season. Going up against a defense that has given up the second most FPPG to opposing RB’s, and as a huge home favorite, Ingram makes for a top 5 RB play in Week 6. He’s a chalk play in DFS, and might be in a week-winning position on Sunday. ** Gus Edwards** and ** Justice Hill**  are no more than handcuffs for worried Ingram owners at this point.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown** 


The Seahawks have managed to grind out a number of wins this year, and last week’s TNF matchup against the Rams was no exception. **Russell Wilson**  basically willed Seattle to victory, and he put on a clinic of efficient passing. He has yet to throw an INT this year, and is making an underwhelming cast of weapons look like a top-10 offense. Even against a solid pass defense that may get their starting CBs back this week, Wilson has been too good this year to consider benching. This does profile as one of the tougher matchups he’s faced this year, so expectations should be tempered slightly. **Tyler Lockett (downgrade)** is unlikely to face consistent coverage from either of the Browns young stud CBs (assuming they play) but his lack of volume of late (4 targets each of the last two weeks) make it harder to project a big week for him. The Browns have been much more vulnerable on the ground than through the air, so expect the overall passing volume to be lowered slightly. Lockett has really only had one big game all year, and it was against NO when the Seahawks were down big early. Assuming the Browns struggle again to put up points offensively, this doesn’t initially project as a game that should feature negative game script. **DK Metcalf (downgrade)** is the more likely WR to face some kind of shadow coverage on the outside, and combining that with his smaller target share, he’s more of a WR4 that you can only start in hopes of one long TD play. **Will Dissly (upgrade)** has been one of the surprises of the season with his strong play, and with the Browns giving up the 8th most FPPG to opposing TEs, he remains firmly planted in the top 8 of the position this week.


**RB Breakdown**


Despite some early fumbling issues, **Chris Carson (upgrade)** has been given a big workload in all but one game this year, and that was in a matchup that featured negative game flow right from the start (Week 3 vs. NO). Carson got 28 touches last week, and caught his only target for the go-ahead TD late in the game. The Browns are fresh off getting absolutely obliterated in the run game by the Niners and now go up against a Seattle team that runs the ball almost as much. Carson is a lock for 20+ touches, and has a great shot at a TD. He’s on the RB1/2 borderline, and just needs a slight uptick in targets to break into the top-12 ROS. **Rashaad Penny (stash)** isn’t garnering enough touches for standalone value, but remains an extremely valuable handcuff.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Nick Chubb (84%, 17, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


There’s no sugarcoating just how bad **Baker Mayfield (upgrade)** has been as a fantasy QB so far this year. He’s barely in the top-30 at the position through 5 weeks, and there’s just something wrong with this offense. This feels like a good game for Mayfield to put up a better line, and he may actually be available on the waiver wire this week. He’s nowhere near back to QB1 status, but going up against a burnable Seahawks secondary in a game the Browns could face some negative game script, Mayfield may surprise this week. We project him as a high end QB2, worth starting for owners in a bye week pinch. The biggest factor for Mayfield’s value is tied to getting **Odell Beckham Jr. (upgrade)** going for more than 2 catches. There are major concerns about OBJ’s fit in this offense with the lack of an offensive line meaning fewer downfield shots, but I think he gets going this week against Seattle. **Jarvis Landry** has only had one big week all year, but his floor in PPR remains usable because of his solid target share and low aDOT leading to high percentage looks. He’s a low upside WR3, and deserves to be bumped to WR4 range in standard leagues. His weekly 5-50 projection is usable, but not extremely exciting. **Antonio Callaway (downgrade)** didn’t move the needle much in his return, and isn’t a must own at this point because of the lack of downfield throwing in this offense.


**RB Breakdown**


One week after steamrolling the Ravens defense on the ground, **Nick Chubb** wasn’t able to get going in a blowout loss to the Niners last week. The volume is still there, and he’s a threat to take it to the house on any given play, so he needs to be in all lineups this week. A bigger role in the passing game would be a boon to his value, so hopefully Freddie Kitchens can find creative ways to get perhaps his most talented player the ball on Sunday.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Carlos Hyde (64%, 21, 1) Duke Johnson (40%, 10, 1)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Last week’s fantasy bonanza against the Falcons featured a massive game from **Deshaun Watson (upgrade)**. KC has actually been stingy against QBs at home this year, but there’s no reason to view Watson as anything other than a top-3 QB play in the week’s highest projected scoring game. **DeAndre Hopkins** was unable to get in on the TD fun last week, but still finished with a respectable 88 yards on seven catches. He’s simply too talented to be held down for long, and has dusted more talented CBs than Breeland with ease over the years. He remains a top 10 WR play, and this is an ideal week for him to bust back onto the scene. **Will Fuller (upgrade)** went absolutely nuclear last week, and probably sent owners who benched him into therapy. There is no sure thing with a boom or bust player like Fuller, but in a shootout with Hopkins drawing likely shadow coverage, Fuller is set up beautifully to back up last week’s performance. He has to be in all lineups. **Keke Coutee** showed a little more last week, but is still only a stash at this point in case of injury to Hopkins or Fuller, not someone you can plug into your lineup.


**RB Breakdown**


This is one of the more frustrating backfields from a fantasy perspective, as either **Carlos Hyde (upgrade standard)** or **Duke Johnson** would be borderline RB1s if given a full workload, but neither is getting the volume necessary for big lines. Hyde is the better bet for a rushing TD, and is likely to get a solid volume of carries in the first half while the Texans try to keep Mahomes and company off the field. That plan could fall apart quickly, but Hyde’s floor is decent in standard leagues. DJ has drawn only 7 targets total over the past 3 weeks, and just isn’t getting the volume to be a worthwhile play. There is hope he’ll be used more in negative game script in a high scoring game, but it would take a major leap of faith to start him. Consider Hyde an RB2/3, with a bump in standard leagues, and Duke an RB4 with upside for a big play or two.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


There was some concern that **Patrick Mahomes** would be limited this week after injuring his ankle last week, but he has been clear that the issue won’t stop him from being at his best on Sunday. He’s an easy top-3 QB. **Tyreek Hill** may have an opportunity to return this week after logging two limited practices, so keep a close eye on his status heading into the weekend. Houston held up better than the stats showed against Matt Ryan last week, but would be absolutely no match for one of the better QB-WR duos in the league, assuming health. **Sammy Watkins** was a DNP on Thursday with a hammy issue, and his status looks to be a legitimate concern. If Hill is unable to return and Watkins can’t play, **Byron Pringle** would get in the mix in 3 wide sets next to **Demarcus Robinson** and **Mecole Hardman**. All three would be in play as WR3’s in this matchup if Hill and Watkins are out, but Robinson is probably the best bet if Hill or Watkins do play, considering his target share. **Travis Kelce (upgrade)** will need to step up in Watkins can’t play, so look for him to again have a big role and put up top-3 TE numbers.


**RB Breakdown**


One of the messier backfields so far this year surprisingly got a lot more clear when **Damien Williams** returned to the lineup last week. He immediately returned to starter status, receiving 12 touches to **Lesean McCoy’s** 2 touches, and **Darrel Williams’** 0 touches. Because Damien is used so frequently in the passing game, his floor should be that of a decent RB2, especially in PPR leagues. His ceiling in a projected shootout like this is top-10, so he should be in all lineups barring a late injury setback. McCoy could get a few more touches this week, but likely needs to be benched, and Darrel Williams becomes just a handcuff for Damien owners. Damien may just be able to pay off for patient owners who were able to survive his early season injury.

**Teddy ‘Checkdown’ Bridgewater** exploded last week against a poor Tampa secondary, throwing for 314 yards with 4 scores. Even with the breakout week, he’s no more than a 2QB league play or a one week streamer in good matchups. **Michael Thomas (upgrade)** has not slowed down in the absence of **Drew Brees** and it appears he’s a matchup proof WR1 moving forward, just keep in mind there may be some bumps along the way with Bridgewater at the controls. It appears that CB Jalen Ramsey is truly questionable to play (Jag’s owner Shahid Khan has said he’ll play, grain of salt), and his absence would be a huge upgrade to Thomas’ outlook. **Tre’Quan Smith (ankle)** was unable to return with an injury last week and **Ted Ginn** found his way into the endzone with a long score, but none of the peripheral pass catchers should be considered. **Jared Cook** finally showed up, posting 4-41-1 last week. He can be considered a low-end TE1 in a mediocre matchup, just remember his floor is scary low. 


**RB Breakdown**


**Alvin Kamara** has popped up on the injury report late in the week which is never a good sign. He’s fully expected to play, but owners should grab **Latavius Murray** as an insurance policy. The matchup for the Saints running game is as optimal as they come, Jacksonville ranks dead last in Run DVOA and is giving up 23.1 FPPG to running backs.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Rookie mistakes cost **Gardner Minshew (upgrade)** last week as he lost 3 fumbles, but he still gave his team a chance to win in a back and forth battle with the Panthers. Minshew has been as consistent as they come at the QB position, he has averaged 17.8 FPPG and has yet to score less than 16 fantasy points since taking over as the starter. If Minshew puts up a big week against a solid NO defense, he will likely be impossible to keep out of lineups. Consider him a back-end QB1 against the Saints middle of the road defense - they are giving up 23.7 FPPG to quarterbacks, third worst. **D.J. Chark** continued his impressive breakout, showing out with 8-164-2 last week. He can’t be denied a spot in your lineup due to upside, even with a date against Marshon Lattimore who just held Mike Evans to a goose egg, consider him a WR2 this week. Another good week and he may be pushing into the WR1 ranks. If Lattimore does indeed shadow Chark, then **Dede Westbrook** would draw the better matchup, going against SCB P.J. Williams. Consider him an upside WR3. **Chris Conley** isn’t seeing enough volume to be a consistent option in fantasy and is best left on the wire. The Saints secondary has been exploitable this season, giving up 28.6 FPPG to wideouts. Continue to fade Jacksonville’s tight ends, but keep an eye on Geoff Swaim. He may assume some volume with fellow tight end James O’Shaughnessy announced out for the year with an ACL tear.    


**RB Breakdown**


**Leonard Fournette** has received the second most touches (115) so far this season, only behind superhuman Christian McCaffery (136). The matchup on paper isn’t ideal, NO is only giving up 14 FPPG to running backs. However, Fournette’s volume provides him a safe floor and he should be in all lineups.

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The most valuable player to the Eagles last week was wearing a Jets jersey, and his name is Luke Falk. He allowed the Eagles D to turn two mistakes into TDs, and was unable to put anything together on offense. This meant that none of the Philly weapons on offense needed to do much to win, so **Carson Wentz** ended with a slightly disappointing day. His matchup this week is significantly tougher against a defense that has given up the 8th fewest FPPG to opposing QBs and ranks as a top 10 defense in both pass and run DVOA. He is still a solid QB1 option. **Alshon Jeffery (upgrade standard)** is back to full health and this week goes up against Xavier Rhodes, who has been burned by Jeffery in past matchups (Rotoworld). This isn’t a shy away matchup for either Wentz or Jeffery, and because the Eagles have a strong run defense, the Vikings strategy to control the game on the ground may not be as successful. This feels like a game where Jeffery hits the end zone. **Zach Ertz** remains a reliable weekly top-3 TE due to target share and his connection with Wentz is in fine form. **Nelson Agholor (drop)** likely only has one week left of receiving a decent target share with DJax possibly returning next week, so he can be dropped for someone with better ROS outlook. He has the potential to sneak into the endzone this week, but his floor is that of a 0 catch 0 yard performance. Wentz is a back end QB1 this week, and Jeffery is right on the edge of a top-20 ranking at WR.


**RB Breakdown**


The Eagles have employed an RBBC so far this year, and in Week 5 found the split between **Jordan Howard (downgrade PPR)** and **Miles Sanders** to be almost exactly equal. Howard is getting the more valuable redzone carries, so his TD upside put his at the back end of the RB2 rankings. Sanders hasn’t been extremely efficient with his carries, and isn’t being used in the passing game as much as some had projected, but his four catches in Week 5 were encouraging. Coach Doug Pederson has said the Eagles will continue to ride the hot hand, and that appears to be Howard at the moment. Both can be used in the flex spot, but Howard is a safer option because of his tendency to end up in the end zone the past weeks (5 in last 3 games).

**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


The Vikings passing game finally got up and running a bit last week, and **Kirk Cousins (upgrade)** finished with his best game of the season. On paper, this looks like a matchup to exploit through the air, as the Eagles are much more vulnerable there than on the ground, but it remains to be seen if OC Kevin Stefanski will adjust his gameplan at all. Cousins can be looked at in 2QB leagues, but still isn’t sniffing QB1 status until we see a consistent uptick in passing volume. He makes for an intriguing streamer this week, however. **Adam Thielen** has been Cousins’ preferred target the past few weeks, and has gotten his target share up close to 25%. While he still isn’t producing like the WR1 he was drafted to be, this week again sets up well for him to put up solid numbers. He should be in all lineups and can be counted on for WR2 numbers. **Stefon Diggs (upgrade)** is a slightly more risky proposition. He currently has a smaller target share than his starting RB, and has only one game over 50 yards receiving. While it’s tough to bench a player of Diggs’ talent, owners are likely extremely frustrated with his production so far. This feels like a get right matchup against the Eagles burnable secondary so we recommend you start him universally. Keep the faith for this week. **Kyle Rudolph (drop)** currently has a lower target share than his backup **Irv Smith** which tells the story of his fantasy irrelevance. If you’ve been holding this long, it’s time to let go.


**RB Breakdown**


Even in an extremely tough matchup this week, **Dalvin Cook** remains a top-3 RB play in all formats. He has shown his floor even in a game the Vikings are losing (Week 4 vs. CHI) to be 15+ points, so he is a clear auto-start. There may be some efficiency struggles on the ground due to Philly’s stout front seven, but he will bust at least one big play, and his involvement in the passing game keeps him elite even in the event the Eagles get out to a big lead. **Alexander Mattison (stash)** remains one of the league’s best handcuffs, so he should be universally owned. If you own Mattison but not Cook, consider seeing what you can pry from the Cook owner over the next few weeks.

**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 5:** Chris Thompson (54%, 9, 7) Adrian Peterson (27%, 7, 0) Wendall Smallwood (19%, 6, 0)


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Interim coach Bill Callahan has yet to name a starter at quarterback, but all indications point to **Case Keenum** being under center this week. He’s not an option in fantasy, but his return is great news for **Terry McLaurin** who seems to be recovered from a hamstring injury. The bad news is that ‘F1’ McLaurin will be facing off against the Dolphins best player, CB Xavien Howard. Nevertheless, McLaurin has earned must start status as a WR2 and he’ll be facing the worst defense in the NFL. Fire him up. **Paul Richardson** with a healthy McLaurin is too much of a question mark to see lineups even in the dream matchup. **Vernon Davis** is still making his way back from a concussion and it’s unclear if he will play. **Jeremy Sprinkle** and **Jerome Cunningham** will take over again if he is absent, but neither are recommended plays. 
 

**RB Breakdown**


Owners probably scooped up **Adrian Peterson (upgrade)** after the news broke that interim coach Callahan thinks that not running the ball enough is Washington's main issue (it’s not). He’s got a dream matchup on deck and should be considered a RB2/3, his floor remains scary low but it seems more likely than not that he finds pay dirt in Week 6’s poop fest. **Chris Thompson (upgrade PPR)** continues to produce in PPR, putting up a consistent 11.7 FPPG. Thompson can be considered a back-end RB2 with an upgrade in PPR formats. This game seems like it could go either way in terms of being high scoring or low scoring, so all options are a bit risky. 


#**Dolphins**


**Opp (WSH) Pass DVOA:** #28


**Opp (WSH) Run DVOA:** #18


**Injuries to Watch DEF (WSH):** LB Josh Harvey-Clemons (Q)


**Injuries to Watch OFF (MIA):** None


**Key WR/CB matchups:** None


**Relevant Target Share %’s (season):** Preston Williams (22%) DeVante Parker (18%) Kenyan Drake (15%) Jakeem Grant (14%)


**RB Snap %/Touches/Targets Week 4:** Kenyan Drake (57%, 15, 6) Mark Walton (27%, 8, 2) Kalen Ballage (16%, 2, 1)  


**QB/WR/TE Breakdown**


Miami from an offense standpoint, and just an overall football standpoint, have been awful. Remember that when Vegas favors a home team by 3 points, that’s essentially saying that both teams are completely even. **Josh Rosen** isn’t a fantasy option. **Preston Williams** and **Devante Parker** can be considered this week going against Washington's dreadful secondary, but really you probably have a better option at receiver. Even in the best matchup of the year, all Miami players are an extreme risk. Put your money on teams that you know can move the ball. **Albert Wilson** is an intriguing DFS play against a defense that has allowed the fourth-most PPR per game to slow WRs this season (per Sports Info Solutions and Rotoworld). Don’t play a Miami tight end, you know better. 


**RB Breakdown**


The running back rotation for Miami is an absolute mess and no running back has produced enough to see fantasy lineups. After a mistake filled start to the season, it appears that **Kalen Ballage** has fallen out of favor for rookie **Mark Walton**. If there were a surefire week to start **Kenyan Drake**, it seems like it would be this week. However, the Dolphins have been so putrid it seems like more risk than it’s worth. Fade the Dolphins backfield where possible.

How to kick someone out of NFL Fantasy League?,"Hey everyone, so we recently had a guy in our league just completely self-destruct and it's kind of ruining the experience and integrity of the game for the rest of us. This person accidentally dropped Tyler Lockett and put out a claim that ""if anyone picks him up, I'll never play again"". Well, of course, someone put in a waiver claim and we basically told him ""talk to the commissioner to fix it"". His response was to drop everyone on his own team. What's worse is he's still in the NFL discussions tab writing trolling comments to everyone.

The commissioner is super busy with family and has barely put any effort into making sure there's a fair outcome for everyone. Other players are upset that, as it stands right now, anyone who faces that player just receives an auto-win for the week.

Buy low with Air Yards: Week 5,"Hey all! I'm back to share Air Yards and Air Yards Opportunity Delta leaders for week 5!

**What are Air Yards?**

Air yards measures the sum of the depths of all of a receiver's targets.

**What is Air Yards Opportunity Delta?**

Opportunity Delta is the difference between a receiver's **air yards** and their **actual yardage.** In Josh Hermsmeyer's words, ""We can use air yards to help us unearth which receivers the quarterback and coaches would like to see get the ball—knowing that has predictive value.""

**Why should I care?**

This metric shows which receivers could stand the most to improve given their current opportunity. Perhaps their QB can't get on the same page as them. Maybe they just had a bad matchup or bad luck. But receivers on this list are getting lots of targets and opportunities, which generally correlates well with performance.

This data is available freely at Josh's website [airyards.com](https://airyards.com/). I've decided to compile a top-15 list of receivers by both Opportunity Delta as well as air yards. Enjoy!

"With a bunch of players in concussion protocol recently (Shep, Mason, Hock, etc) I felt this article is good for people to understand how it works and how to estimate your players coming back into a game","https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/9/18/12940926/nfl-concussion-protocol-explained

>**Return to play process**

>In addition to the in-game protocol, there is also a ""Return-to-Participation Protocol"" that can keep players out of action for more practices or games until they pass through and are cleared to return.

>It is a five-step process without any set timeline for a full return from a concussion:

>1) Rest and recovery: Until a player returns to the ""baseline level of signs and symptoms and neurological examination,"" only limited stretching and balance activities are recommended. Electronics, social media and team meetings are all to be avoided.

>2) Light aerobic exercise: The NFL recommends 10-20 minutes on a stationary bike or treadmill without resistance training or weight training. The cardiovascular activity is monitored by an athletic trainer to ""determine if there are any recurrent concussion signs or symptoms.""

>3) Continued aerobic exercise and introduction of strength training: Increased duration and intensity of aerobic exercise with strength training added. An athletic trainer will supervise to watch for recurrent concussions signs or symptoms.

>4) Football specific activities: The cognitive load of playing football will be added and players will participate in non-contact activities for the typical duration of a full practice.

>5) Full football activity/clearance: A player returns to full participation in practice, including contact without restriction.

Using a current example of Hock with the latest tweet coming from this excerpt: [A little T.J. Hockenson update from Matt Patricia: Hockenson is doing everything in practice. Still has one more day of doing that, then being re-checked by doctors before he's out of concussion protocol. Brain injuries are unpredictable, but Hockenson trending towards playing](https://twitter.com/davebirkett/status/1182679061799276545?s=21), there's a good chance from this tweet that Hock is currently in step 4 of the process and now needs to pass one last exam.  Hock owners should feel pretty good about this since with a Monday game, it gives Hock an extra day of rest and hopefully will allow him to exit protocol to be ready for the game.
